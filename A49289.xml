            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
            <p>FRiend, whoever thou art, into whoſe hands this inſuing piece may come; I muſt ſay, the rudeneſs of ſpeech and unpoliſhed ſtile of the enſuing Book, doth neceſſarily (not complementally) call for a Prologue or Preface of Apology for it ſelf; and this I ſay in its behalf, that it was never intended for ſo publick a view in the firſt ſtudy of it, but only to be communicated to that ſmall Congregation over which I am concerned by the providence and grace of God, as a Paſtor or Feeder; to whom or in whoſe hearing theſe things were more largely handled, for the ſpace of one whole Year by the Author, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to have left it, had not ſtrong and following importunities from ſeveral who had been hearers of the matter more largely, changed my mind and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me to publiſh it; and if any by the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation receive any profit, they are debters to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named under God for it.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am (I can ſay truly) deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of much imperfection in the management, and that I ſhall need thy candid and favourable indulgence overlooking manner and heeding matter, as it agrees with the current of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The brokenneſs and imperfections hereof were partly occaſioned by the length of time, ſince they were delivered; and partly that thoſe notes remaining in
<pb facs="tcp:33055:3"/>my hands were very conciſe and brief, being but the very heads of the matter inſiſted on: this I only leave as a modeſt plea for my ſelf, knowing that truth is of age to ſpeak for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed to an Introduction to the matter it ſelf, contained in the following diſcourſe. The matter before us is excellent matter, though wrapt up in Parables, not with a deſign to lock it from us, but that in condeſcending to ſet forth heavenly things by earthly, we might the eaſier come at the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now this we muſt know, that all terms and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in a Parable are not for probation but il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration: a Parable will not always (as we ſay,) run upon all four, but we muſt eye and obſerve the ſcope and deſign of a Parable; and it is the work of a Goſpel Miniſter not only to Preach, but to expound and open the Scriptures, and divide (or cut aſunder) the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, giving each their Portion. It was the work of our Lord Chriſt when he was on earth, not only to preach, as we find him doing, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. but expounding the Scriptures. See that remarkable place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27. beginning at <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf; though the Scriptures do in good meaſure expound themſelves if well obſerved, yet the Lord in all ages appointed inſtruments for that work, God foreſaw there would be need of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. When the <hi>Eunuch</hi> read the Prophet, he wanted ſome body to guide him, and God guides <hi>Philip</hi> to do this office. God uſually conveys light by inſtruments whom he firſt inlightens.</p>
            <p>The Subject which we have before us is a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching Subject if ſeriouſly heeded; and as heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is the principal and only work which Profeſſors are to be converſant about in this latter day, ſo it is to be feared there is no work more ſuperficially car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by moſt; ſome not knowing what it means, others forgetful of their hearts, not obſerving <hi>Solomons</hi> Counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. to keep the heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his days did foreſee in the laſt days many Profeſſors would be looſe as to this
<pb facs="tcp:33055:3"/>main duty, which makes him to predict it unto his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Now (as I ſaid before) the great deſign of our Lord here, is, that his Diſciples waiting for him ſhould have grace in their hearts, a good inſide as well as a Profeſſion, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt doth loudly call for a good heart, and he knew then the outſide would be good alſo; for ſaith Chriſt, A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, brings forth that which is good.</p>
            <p>But miſtake me not, I do not in the leaſt by what I ſay deſign to ſlight or undervalue Profeſſion; but my deſign and aim is to arm you againſt degenerating into meer form, and a Carcaſs of Religion without the Spirit and power of it.</p>
            <p>That ſtate is very nauſeous and offenſive to Gods all-ſeeing Eye, who would have the Churches to know, that he is the ſearcher of the heart and the tryer of the reins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. The Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> was then in her Wane, when ſhe had a name to live and was dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3. her fault was not that ſhe had a name to live, but that ſhe had the <hi>name</hi> without the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> and what was it that gave her this name to <hi>live?</hi> was it not the <hi>form,</hi> Church Memberſhip, Ordinances? and what was it that denominated her to be dead, but want of <hi>faith, love, zeal,</hi> yea <hi>Oyl</hi> in the <hi>heart?</hi> had not theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> a <hi>name</hi> to live? are they not called <hi>Virgins,</hi> a living <hi>name,</hi> but wanted <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>Root?</hi> Had not theſe Servants of Chriſt a name to live, whilſt called Chriſts own Servants? but they wanted <hi>love, faith,</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> to Chriſt their Lord in his buſineſs: had not theſe Goats a name to live? were they not clean Creatures and allowed for ſacrifice? and was not a Kid of the Goat equally acceptable as a Lamb of the flock? but all theſe are rejected by Chriſt for want of life in the root.</p>
            <p>This conſideration makes me in the Subject follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpend ſo much time and pains in demonſtrating <hi>ſincerity</hi> from <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> as you will find as you go along; Oh! <hi>ſincerity</hi> is the <hi>life</hi> of all, a <hi>perfect heart</hi> is that which renders a weak Perſon although defective in many things, yet acceptable with God. Take notice of thoſe two remarkable paſſages between <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Amaziah,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33055:4"/>2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.17. though the high places were not taken away, yet the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Aſa</hi> was <hi>perfect</hi> all his days, ſee the contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.2. concerning <hi>Amaziah,</hi> he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a <hi>perfect heart.</hi> God meaſures men by their hearts, whether in good or evil actions; no man can keep acquaintance and fellowſhip with God without a <hi>perfect heart;</hi> though he may poſſibly keep fellowſhip with the Church, yet Chriſt knows not ſuch, but ſo as to reject them with a Depart, I know you not.</p>
            <p>My dear and Chriſtian Friends, who are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the race and are aiming at the Crown; <hi>ſo run that ye may obtain;</hi> it is not every running will ſerve, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the beſt of running will ſerve, if not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in to the end; the <hi>Galatians</hi> did run well, yet ceaſt too ſoon the very beſt of Profeſſors had need to ſet theſe awakening conſiderations before their Eyes, in this back ſliding, ſleeping, ſlumbring day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the beſt of <hi>Virgins</hi> if not fallen into a dead ſleep, yet they ſlumber; <hi>they all ſlumbred and ſlept:</hi> and let the conſideration of the miſcarrying of the former Churches awaken us in time. What became of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the former Apoſtolical Churches, is not their Glory laid in the duſt long ago?</p>
            <p>Now as formality without life and power, was the very thing that prepared the Church of the Jews, Gods circumciſed Church, for caſting out of his preſence as a dead Carcaſe, ſo the ſame formality was the ruin of theſe firſt Churches, as we may perceive.</p>
            <p>For this is a certain truth, that by how much the nearer any ſort of Perſons come to God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and yet live not up to it, it doth provoke God to the moſt ſevere proceedings againſt ſuch; as for example, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Levit.</hi> 10. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira. Act.</hi> 5. and many more; there is enough in this Chapter ſo awaken us to conſider, Perſons ſo near to Chriſt, having ſuch boldneſs and confidence, yet not known by him.</p>
            <p>To conſider what a cloſe mixture here is between theſe perſons, all as it were of one Society, of one
<pb facs="tcp:33055:4"/>Family, Chriſts own Sevants, of one Flock, till Chriſt ſevers them.</p>
            <p>Now our Lords great deſign in theſe Parables, is (upon pain of eternal miſcarriage and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) to provoke induſtry and faithfulneſs in all Chriſts Talents and intruſtments; and that from a right root, that we may plainly gather if we obſerve: Therefore have a ſpecial care of ſloth, and negligence in Chriſts ſervice, that is greatly diſtaſteful to him; and conſider my Friends, that there is no one grace more acceptable to Chriſt and conducing more to future profit than <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Almes</hi> to the Poor: thoſe whom Chriſt hath intruſted with the Talent of this Worlds goods, as Stewards, he expects ſhould as need require diſpenſe them in his houſe; ſee how Chriſt takes it in this Chapter, ver. 35. <hi>For I was an hungry and ye gave me meat, thirsty and ye gave me drink, naked and ye cloathed me:</hi> Chriſt takes it as done to his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is pleaſed to found their bleſſedneſs upon that foundation; if any omiſſion in theſe near to Chriſt renders them Goats it is that they had not fed nor cloathed Chriſt in his Brethren, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>If what I have ſaid in my following labour may be a means but to awaken one Perſon to look to his or her ſtanding, and examine their State for eternity, I ſhall be bound to bleſs God for his aſſiſtance in the work. I cannot but ſay I did experience ſome quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in my ſtudy of it, the ſame I deſire for you in the reading of it.</p>
            <p>But I would not hold you too long in this Porch or Preface; I ſhall refer you to the Book it ſelf, which I deſire you to read with care and conſideration; I ſhall only leave Five or Six general rules as to the work of ſelf-examination and proviſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Have a ſpecial care you miſtake not in the two great fundamental points of Repentance and Faith; for there may be a counterfeit Repentance and Faith; ſee they be true of the right kind. Many miſcarry upon this miſtake, thinking they have them, when indeed they have them not.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:33055:5"/>
            <p>Secondly, Know this for a truth, that where one miſcarries through deſpair, hundreds periſh through preſumption; which is the State of thoſe pointed at by Chriſt in theſe Parables.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Improve preſent means and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to get Oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſee there is a time when it is too late; Seek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, is Chriſts Counſel, and to ſuch ſeeking is a certain promiſe made, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.8.17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Have a ſpecial care of too much love to preſent things, that is very dangerous; if any man love the World, the love of God cannot be in him: this hinders Charity, no ſin ſo contrary to true Saintſhip; a Saint is much in Heaven, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians.</hi> 3.20.</p>

               </gap>eſt not content with the meaſure of grace received, but add to and labour to grow in grace, Trade for Heaven; it is Gods mind that beſides getting into Chriſt we ſhould grow in him; to whom much is given, of him much is required, as we ſee in this Chapter; and he that hath leaſt muſt make it more, one Talent muſt increaſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; grace if true is communicative alſo to others.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Study much the near approach of the day of reckoning; it is not long at the longeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt will come to reckon with you; ſet your accounts ready againſt that day; that you may give your account ſo as that Chriſt may ſay, Well done, good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will make thee Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over many things; or as <hi>Luke,</hi> Ruler over Ten Cities.</p>

            <p>THE Prophets have foretold, that in the laſt days, the earth ſhall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, and knowledge ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. And bleſſed be God we ſee theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies in great meaſure fulfilled, though not to that degree and univerſal extent they ſhall be, but the light is growing on more and more unto the perfect day. Now among other ways and means whereby this knowledge hath been ſpread, the writings of the Servants of God in all ages have greatly advanced and propagated the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. And they eſpecially are to be commended who by their diligent and faithful labours have opened the Holy Scriptures unto us, that by the light thereof we may ſee light. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of the number of Gods faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that have imployed their Talents this way, the Author of this Treatiſe is one, according to the Subject he hath handled. And though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word of God is pure, and highly to be priz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:33055:6"/>yet it must be confeſſed, that ſome protions of Holy Scripture are more uſeful and profitable than others. Such is the wiſdom that God hath given to this Author, in directing his heart to pitch upon one of the moſt ſeaſonable Subjects for the day and age we live in, The Parable of the Virgins. What can be more neceſſary! For the diſcovery of Hypocriſie, in the fooliſh Virgins; For the awakening of ſleepy, drowſy Chriſtians in the wiſe Virgins. So for the Parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; To provoke all to a faithful improving of all the gifts and graces committed to their trust by their great Lord and Maſter, that when he comes again to call all his Servants to account, we may receive the reward, and enter into the joy of our Lord.</p>
            <p>For the third and laſt part, concerning the eternal judgment, a Subject of all other most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; When there ſhall be a final determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all mens eſtates for ever, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But not to prevent what is more copiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of by the Author himſelf in all theſe particulars in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>For the manner of handling theſe Subjects, I dare promiſe thee (if thou beeſt one that hath any reliſh of the moſt important truths contained in the Holy Scriptures) that thou wilt find a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour running through the whole diſcourſe, as one that felt what he firſt ſpoke, and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:33055:6"/>unto writing, for thy ſouls good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and indeed they are the fitteſt perſons to treat of ſuch Subjects as theſe are. To conclude; The Author hath no other deſigne and end of writing this but thy ſpiritual edification and advantage; That thou maiſt prove a wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and ſo improve thy Talents, that thou maiſt ſtand in the judgment. Which is alſo the ſincere and hearty deſire of</p>

            <p>THat which firſt ingaged my heart, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to enter upon this Portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was theſe two conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The excellent matter of inſtruction, that was coucht under theſe three Parables laid down in this Chapter; the tendancy whereof, is to provoke Chriſtians to ſtrict and cordial ſelf-examination, after their inward and ſpiritual Eſtate, before it be too late.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſerious conſideration of that Period of time which they point at; being the time a little before Chriſt's ſecond coming, which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by a ſhort view of the precedent Chapter; moſt of which Chapter is ſpent (in anſwer to the Diſciples threefold demand) in laying down the more remote, and more immediate fore-runners of Chriſt's ſecond coming. Now in this 25 Chapter we muſt either underſtand our Lord, ſtill proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame deſign; in giving yet more and other predictions relating to his coming; or elſe we muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33055:10"/>underſtand him ſpeaking of ſome remarkable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that ſhall fall-in contemporary with thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſigns: And I take this latter ſence to be moſt coherent with the ſcope of the whole Context; that is to ſay, that when the former remarkable ſigns and paſſages ſhall appear, and the Son of Man is near to his ſecond coming, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Then</hi> ſhall the State of the Church, and Profeſſors be fitly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to what is ſet forth by theſe <hi>Parables.</hi> And to this agrees the vulgar Latin, who thus read (in that point of <hi>time,</hi>) their rendring this firſt word in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals as a remarkable period.</p>

                     <hi>Then</hi> in that point of time, when! (according to the precedent ſigns,) Chriſts coming draws near; <hi>(the kingdom of Heaven.)</hi> What may we in this Text underſtand by the kingdom of Heaven? <hi>(I anſw.)</hi> According to the generality of Interpreters, kingdom of Heaven in this place is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Church, State; and ſo it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from Coriſts mouth elſewhere, as <hi>Math.</hi> 16.19. the words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter; I gave unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the context muſt be underſtood; as alſo <hi>Math.</hi> 23.13. in Chriſt's words to the Scribes and Phariſees, that ſhut up the kingdom of Heaven,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33055:10"/>kept perſons out of the faith and Church of Chriſt: ſo muſt <hi>Paul</hi> be underſtood, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. where he calleth the Church, the kingdom of Gods dear Son, into which himſelf and the <hi>Coloſſions</hi> were brought or tranſlated, <hi>(be likened)</hi> or reſembled the State of the Church in that juncture of time; and conſider, who made this compariſon? It is Jeſus Chriſt, who was wiſdom it ſelf, who did not uſe to make impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per compariſons, but if Chriſt ſay they are like, it is ſo; and in this reſemblance, our Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the manner of their ſolemnizing the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in thoſe Countrys and times, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Hiſtory was in the Nights, and ſo Lamps were needful; in which weddings, there were a choice company of young men called Sons of the Bride-chamber, and a choice and pickt company of Virgins, of the Bride kindred and acquaintance, to attend the Bridegroom at his coming; to which it is thought <hi>David</hi> doth alude, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 45. Now ſaith Chriſt, the Church State ſhall be a meet reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance hereunto in that day, <hi>(unto ten.)</hi> The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what kind of number this muſt be? Is this to be underſtood in a proper and ſtrict fence? <hi>(I anſw.)</hi> We are not bound to underſtand this in a ſtrict ſence, preciſely <hi>ten;</hi> becauſe we have by this certain number <hi>ten,</hi> an indefinent large and uncertain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: As for inſtance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8. the words of <hi>Elkanah</hi> to <hi>Hannah: Am not I better to thee than ten Sons.</hi> So in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.43. <hi>We have ten parts in David, Eccle.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Wiſdom ſtrengthneth more than ten mighty men. Zac.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Ten men ſhall take hold of the skirt of a Jew. Ten women ſhall bake in one Oven:</hi> all which numbers are ſignificantly to be underſtood of a large indefinite number, and not preciſely <hi>ten.</hi> So here, when Chriſt ſaith <hi>ten,</hi> he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33055:11"/>muſt be underſtood as from ſeeing large numbers coming in at that juncture of time. But why <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins? (anſw.)</hi> by Virgins muſt be underſtood ſuch at leaſt who profeſs holineſs: In worſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, holy Perſons are ſet out by this appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Virgins,</hi> ſuch were the Church of <hi>the Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you a Chaſt Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> this is the proper epithite to Chriſts Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. <hi>the Virgins love thee,</hi> by <hi>Virgins</hi> ſometimes is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ſuch as have eſcaped the falſe worſhip of the World, as it is underſtood <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Theſe are they which are not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins;</hi> and in this ſence, the worſt of theſe might be <hi>Virgins,</hi> theſe Perſons in our Text are ſet forth by a fourfold Character. 1. They are called <hi>Virgins.</hi> 2. They are ſaid to have Lamps or viſible profeſſion commonly underſtood. 3. They are ſaid to be gone out, they are not like the Sluggard, who only with and deſire, and lie ſtill; but theſe are gone out, up and doing; theſe are gone to ſeek, gone to meet. 4. They are gone to meet Chriſt as a Bridegroom, with ſome hope, joy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as they that have an intereſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Having thus opened the words, I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe obſervable Doctrines, that flows from the words.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall give a brief hint to each of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the great number of Profeſſors, that ſhall come in the latter days, I have in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this number <hi>ten,</hi> ſhewed you that it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a large indefinent number. This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.5. <hi>The abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted unto thee, and the forces of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee;</hi> ver. 8. <hi>They ſhall flock like Doves to the windows; Chriſts houſe will be furniſhed with Gueſts, Math.</hi> 22.10. Many are called, Jeſus Chriſt did foreſee that the harveſt would be very great, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.37. But ſome may object, was not this fulfilled in the beginning of the Goſpel, when there were 3000 converted at one Sermon of <hi>Peters, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>(I anſw.)</hi> No, Firſt, becauſe thoſe then converted were Jews, but theſe propheſied of, are Gentiles; and Secondly, this plentiful flowing in, is contemporary with thoſe ſigns and immediate fore-runners of Chriſts coming. Ch. 24.</p>
                  <p>Now that which ſhall occaſion this large flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, in that juncture of time; may be theſe circumſtances:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From that great increaſe of light, that ſhall break out in that Day, which was propheſied of by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 12.4. <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledg ſhall be increaſed;</hi> which doth refer to that time, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we may perceive by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33055:12"/>Context. We read alſo of an Angel coming down from Heaven, by whoſe means the Earth is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.1. the firſt fruit whereof we ſee in our days.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe may ariſe from the great noiſe of Chriſts ſecond coming, which ſhall be made more than formerly, which ſhall awaken many and cauſe them to run forth: The Doctrin of the latter days near Chriſts ſecond coming will run much upon this Subject; this was foreſeen by <hi>Malachy,</hi> Chap. 3 as we may alſo gather out of the Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe dreadful and amazing diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, that ſhall take place in the latter days, when thoſe ſigns ſpoken of <hi>Math.</hi> 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. ſhall begin to come to paſs, <hi>this ſhall make all the Tribes of the Earth to mourn, Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25, 26. Mens hearts failing at the ſight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>From hence we may be informed, that we are upon the borders of the latter days, we have not only ſeen ſome forerunners of Chriſts coming in other reſpects, but we have in ſome part ſeen this alſo; great numbers of perſons have flowed in, in theſe 20 years paſt much more than formerly. So much for the firſt Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is drawn from this appellation king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, Chriſt doth not inconſiderately, but with good conſideration ſo call it. From whence I draw the ſecond part, That the Church of Chriſt here on Earth, ought to bear a lively reſemblance of the State of glory, and that in four Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From their compactneſs, the Church of Chriſt

                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  </p>

You that are Church members, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after holineſs; if you arrive not at holineſs here, you ſhall never have it hereafter; the truth of this Doctrin is confirmed by the third Doctrin which I ſhall only name.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> That all that truly wait for Chriſt, are or ought to be-<hi>Virgins:</hi> I have already ſhewed you in the explication, what is intended by Chriſt in this appellation; they that the Scripture gives this appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to or name of <hi>Virgins,</hi> unto ſuch as are holy Perſons.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> That all that truly wait for Chriſt are gone forth, they are raiſed from their Bed of carnal ſecurity: The Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church, Chap. 13.13. doth emphatically call their ſufferings for Chriſt, going forth; <hi>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</hi> The Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1.2. While ſhe ſeeks Chriſt upon her Bed, found him not; ſhe muſt ariſe and go forth to ſeek her beloved, whom her Soul loves; this going forth ſuppoſeth a ſequeſtration in a great meaſure, from earthly injoyments, and this the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> calls for, <hi>Joel,</hi> 2 16. <hi>Let the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom go out of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet</hi> in order to ſeeking God: that is, from their lawful injoyments; this going forth ſuppoſeth love to, and deſire after what we go forth after, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Go ye forth (O) ye Daughters of Sion and behold King Solomon.</hi> Sometimes to go forth ſuppoſeth ſtrength and vigour, <hi>Job.</hi> 24.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ves of the stall.</hi> Now when it is ſaid here in this Parable, they went forth, it ſuppoſeth a going forth with ſelf-denial, with leaving in a meaſure their lawful injoyments, their falſe worſhip, and this with ſome love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſtrength and vigor to meet Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> From all which learn this inſtruction; ſee how far the fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> accompany the wiſe <hi>Virgins,</hi> whilſt it is in definently ſaid they went out, theſe did not only come in but go forth to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Doct.</hi> Was this, That thoſe truly gone forth to meet Jeſus Chriſt have or ought to have Lamps; they took their Lamps, elſe they had no ways benefit to go forth upon this deſign; Lamps were abſolutely neceſſary for this expedition, a veſſel to contain the Oyl: And theſe are no blamed that they took their Lamps, for although there are ſome that have Lamps and no ſupply of Oyl, yet we find not any that have Oyl and no Lamp: we have a generation in our days, that would pretend to have Oyl and no Lamp, the power of godlineſs without a form; this cannot be, although a Perſon may have a form and not the power, yet none we read of that have the power without the form, it is <hi>commendable</hi> to have Lamps: The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> exhorts them to hold faſt their profeſſion, which lay in a viſible mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the inſtitutions of Chriſt, together with a good converſation; the fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> were right ſo far, they took their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only commend this advice to you from this Doctrin; Do not ſuppoſe grace in your hearts, love to Chriſt in your hearts, ſo long as it doth not appear in your lives and profeſſions <hi>David</hi> would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33055:14"/>not hide his righteouſneſs in his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. but he maketh it to ſhine forth to the benefit of others: You that pretend you are gone forth to meet Chriſt, where are your Lamps? Remember thoſe 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. are not blamed that they have a form of godlineſs, but they were blamed for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power ſo much for the fifth Doctrin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> The ſixt Doctrin reſpects their end and intereſt to meet him as a Bridegroom with joy and incouragement, as being related to Chriſt, as Chriſt being their friend, this going to meet Chriſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth love and reſpect to Chriſt: When <hi>Lot</hi> went forth to meet the Angels, it was for that reſpect <hi>Lot</hi> had to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.1. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> went to meet his Father, it was from that love and reſpect he had to his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.29. And thus the Lord is ſaid to meet him that rejoyce and worketh, this is manifeſt love, affection, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64.5. From the ſame ground the Diſciples went to meet <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 28.15. So that the <hi>Virgins</hi> going forth to meet Chriſt, ſuppoſeth their love and reſpect to Chriſt. Secondly, to meet a Perſon, implies the forwardneſs and deſire of the meeter to injoy the company of the Perſon met, his deſire of fruition is ſuch, that he cannot ſit ſtill till he comes to him; thus the <hi>Harlot</hi> diſcovered the deſire of the fruition of her prey, <hi>Prov</hi> 7.15. She went to meet him, ſhe was not content to fit ſtill till he came to find her out. Now from theſe conſiderations, we cannot imagine theſe to be groſs wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are thus gone out to meet Chriſt in this ſence; neither can they be thought to be ſuch as were to be condemned in themſelves, or of thoſe who would be hidden from the face of Chriſt, according to <hi>Revelations</hi> the ſixth, theſe that thus
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33055:14"/>go forth to meet Chriſt, muſt needs have ſome confidence and hopes of acceptance with him, and therefore could come boldly as we ſee afterwards, with Lord, Lord open to us, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>There are a generation of men that ſhall have great confidence, Living, Dying, and Riſing, and yet at the laſt ſuffer diſappointment; and yet their conſidence is ſo great, that Chriſt can hardly beat them off from it, at the Judgment day, <hi>I tell you I know you not, I profeſs I know you not,</hi> It ſeemeth as if they were hardly prevailed with, to let loſe their hould; but of that more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>We ſee in our Text the fooliſh goe along with the wiſe, have the ſame outward profeſſion, and declare the ſame affection, ſoe far as man could ſee, ſo they go forth to meet Chriſt and that as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. Nay if we take in that parallel place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>They are come into the marriage Chamber, and yet without the wedding Garment;</hi> and theſe fooliſh could not be diſcerned, by their fellows and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſo neither could theſe in the wedding Chamber, the Porter could not diſcern this want of a Wedding Garment, till the King came to ſee the gueſts and then a diſcovery is made, and not before.</p>
                  <p>May not theſe conſiderations put Profeſſors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſerious and deep examination of themſelves, how it ſtands with them as to their ſouls eſtate, for it may eaſily be imagined, that the whole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lay within, and not without; this Wedding Garment muſt be underſtood to be Inward ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, that which God only can ſee and Judg of; I ſhall handle this more fully afterwards in its place, yet I ſhall ſo far anticipate the matter, as to ſpeak a few words here by way of application.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33055:15"/>We have in this Parable vaſt numbers thus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with Lamps and ſet forwards, is not the caſe ours in this day? are there not vaſt numbers of Profeſſors now? and according to this Parable, may not half of them be Fooliſh, and yet no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect appearing outwardly? methinks this ſhould awaken us, to look about us.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to lay down ſome cautions, which I pray you take notice of on the Negative: Firſt, do not truſt to hearing, though Chriſts words many deceive themſelves, whileſt they are hearers and not doers, ſee the 1 <hi>James</hi> 22. Many think they are ſafe becauſe they are hearers, this you ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is one of the falſe grounds of the Fooliſh <hi>Virgins,</hi> hearing will not do, for there we hear of people <hi>Zek.</hi> 33.31, 32. who were hearers, <hi>And they come to thee as the people cometh, and they ſit b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fre thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they ſhew much love but their heart goeth after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song, of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</hi> They came and ſate as Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſed to do, and this is pleaded <hi>Math.</hi> 7. we have them preach in our Streets. Secondly, do not truſt to bare faith in the Son of God, that is, to believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, ſuch a faith thoſe muſt needs have, who caſt out Devils in Chriſts name if a faith that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God will do, the whole nation have it, nay the Devils confeſs Chriſt to be the Son of God. Thirdly, do not truſt to thy confidence of acceptance with God, for this they had. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do not truſt to obedience to Chriſts Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33055:15"/>theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> could not want this. Fifthly, do not truſt to your keeping clear from falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, this they had, or elſe they could not have bourn the name of <hi>Virgins.</hi> Sixthly, do not truſt to thy waiting and deſiring for Chriſts coming, this they had; and we read of a people that deſired the day of the Lord, as in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.18. which ſhould be to them a day of darkneſs and not of light; theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> were gone out to meet the Bridegroom, therefore truſt to none of thoſe.</p>
                  <p>But then may ſome ſay object, what ſhall we then truſt unto, if not in theſe ſix evidences of a ſure and ſafe eſtate? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, when this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration increaſeth, ſo doth thy holineſs increaſe, theſe in our Text were workers of iniquity, for all their confidence, true faith, and hope of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is attended with a gradual purifying life, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3 Chap. 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> Secondly, when thou art ſtrict in thy thoughts and affections, as well as in thy words and actions, ſo was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledg of God, and bringing into captivity, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> So alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>he exerciſed himſelf, to have always a concience void of offence towards God and Man.</hi> Thirdly, when ſecret communion with God, is thy deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all duties performed, and at all times, <hi>John</hi> 1 1.3. <hi>that which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Fourthly, when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of the Spirit maketh thee more humble; thus it was with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 6.5 <hi>Then

The learned tell us, that the word tranſlated Oyl, is the ſame word that ſignifies Light and Noon-day, ſometimes by Oyl is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all good things, or the beſt of things, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.20. <hi>There is Treaſure to be deſired, and Oyl in the Houſe of the wiſe: but a fooliſh Man he ſpendeth it up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is deſireable Treaſure and Oyl in the Houſe of the wiſe; and <hi>Job</hi> meaneth when he ſaith the Rocks poured him out Oyl is all good things comprehenſively underſtood; as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. God nameth Flax an Oyl as the two only things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſometimes under Oyl is ſet forth, as in <hi>Deut</hi> 7.13. alſo <hi>Joel</hi> 3 1. compared with <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17. <hi>He that loveth pleaſure ſhall be a poor man: He that loveth Wine and Oyl ſhall not be Rich.</hi> Thridly. By Oyl ſometimes is underſtood the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33055:17"/>of God, as that which is ſpoken of <hi>Aaron</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.7. <hi>thou loveſt righteouſneſs and hateſt wickedneſs, therefore God, thy God hath anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows.</hi> He is ſo to be anointed with the Oyl of gladneſs above his Fellows, which muſt intend the Spirit of God; the fooliſh had ſome of this Oyl, not a ſtock in the heart. Secondly, What is here underſtood by the Veſſel? <hi>I anſw.</hi> Sometimes by Veſſel is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the whole man, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>but we have this treaſure in Earthen Veſſels;</hi> that is, weak Man, in this fence the Woman is ſaid to be the weaker Veſſel, that is Perſon; but by Veſſel in this place muſt be underſtood the heart, becauſe it is ſuppoſed to the viſibility of profeſſion: And in that ſence it is to be underſtood 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>that every one of you ſhall know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in ſanctification and honour,</hi> that is, the Veſſel that is applied is life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> We have in theſe words five Doctrinal concluſions which are as follows. Firſt, That hypocriſie and ſincerity rightly underſtood, is wiſdom and folly, five wiſe, and five fooliſh. Secondly, That among the multitude of Profeſſors that ſhall be in the laſt days, there are many bad formal Hyppocrites and unwiſe, who ſhall never poſſeſs what they ſeem to be purſuing. Thirdly, Bad and good men meet, Aſſemble and go along together in the outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Religion; theſe all have Lamps alike, and went together as <hi>David</hi> Propheſied of <hi>Judas</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.13. my Familiar that went with me to the Houſe of God in Company, that eat Bread with me, hath lift up his Heel againſt me.

Of theſe in order, not truly, thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to provide for time to come is folly in this ſence, all ſin is folly, and all righteouſneſs is wisdom in <hi>Solomons</hi> Language; Fools makes a mock of ſin, Fools they lay not up for afterwards, thoſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſendeth to the Sluggard to the Ant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Go to the Ant thou Sluggard, conſider her ways and be Wiſe, Solomon</hi> telleth us that wiſdom excelleth folly, as much as light excelleth darkneſs, and how doth he decipher this wiſdom, the wiſe man can ſee, his Eyes are in his head.</p>

                  <p>Firſt to thoſe without: Learn to have another and higher eſteem of Wiſdom, remember the truly wiſe Perſon is he that provideth for the longeſt time to come, this is wiſdom in Chriſt's account, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Therefore whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe Man which built his houſe upon a Rock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly know this, that true wiſdom is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ſin, for he is the only wiſe Man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from evil, that flyes from ſin as from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>And unto Man he ſaid, behold the fear of the Lord that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly as to thoſe within, to poor weak Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that think themſelves unwiſe and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are under diſcouragements; art thou one of thoſe that have laid up the word of God in thy heart? be of good comfort this is true wiſdom, if thou art alſo found doing of his Commandments from the heart: And know that the wiſe ſhall inherit Glory, when ſhame ſhall be the promotion of Fools, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.35.</p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33055:18"/>
                  <p>Now to the ſecond Doctrin, That there will be many bad Profeſſors and Church-Members in the latter days, ſive fooliſh <hi>Virgins.</hi> I might in this Point have an Eye to Gods antient people in their declined State, but I need not, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5.26. <hi>For among my People are found wicked Men.</hi> But the truth of this Doctrine will appear by what Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Parable of the Drag-net caſt into the Sea, which intendeth, the Goſpel-Miniſtry it gathereth bad and good, ſo all the Churches, <hi>Romans, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Coloſſians,</hi> and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> five in ſeven, blame-worthy, ſo in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Perſons very bad, yet holding a form of godlineſs, but what need I look ſo far back, our days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this truth too fully, and whence it ariſeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From that light that breaketh forth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the hardneſs of the work, as ſins Crucifying throughout Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It ariſeth from Satans more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary induſtry in the latter days to deceive.</p>
                  <p>Take an <hi>Uſe</hi> of Caution from this head, firſt have a ſpecial care of condemning profeſſion it ſelf, becauſe there are ſo many bad under it, and in it. Chriſts little Church conſiſting of but twelve, had one bad, even a Son of perdition: conſider the Church of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſtl.</hi> 5.6. had very bad Members in it. Many men are apt to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from this conſideration to keep off from Profeſſion, but know that the Profeſſion is true and good, though bad men may take it up that will not excuſe diſobedience to the form of Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall haſten to the third Doctrin, That Hypocrites, formal Profeſſors and bad Members may meet, and match, go along with the wiſeſt and beſt in the external part of Religion, this Point I ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33055:19"/>not inſiſt upon becauſe it ſeemeth to border upon the former, the truth of this Doctrin, is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, if we look into the Old Teſtament ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, faſtings, ſolemn meetings, the worſt was as forward as the beſt and the Lord had no cauſe to blame them as to that, as you may read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.8. <hi>I will not reprove thee for try ſacrifices or burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to have been continually before me,</hi> and further in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58 2. compared with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.11. they ſate before him as his people, as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.31. the Hypocrites in Chriſts time were found in three choice duties at leaſt in the outward part, as Prayer, Faſting, Alm, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 6. and the firſt ſix ver. thus I paſs this third Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>And now we come to the fourth Doctin, which was this, That the great diſtinguiſhing Character that diſcovereth the wiſe from the fooliſh Profeſſor, it lyeth in the heart, the wiſe had Oyl in their Veſſels, beſides what was in their Lamps; which Veſſel muſt be underſtood the heart as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, if we look under the Law ever ſince God had a People or Church upon the earth in the time of the Circumciſion, here lay the difference, ſome were Circumciſed in the fleſh, and others in heart, ſome only Circumciſed in the fleſh, but none of them were acceptable to God, but thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart; he only had praiſe of God, as you may read in <hi>Rom</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the Spirit and not in the better, whoſe praiſe is of God, and not of Men.</hi> Here lay the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Aſa</hi>

                  <p>Fifth <hi>Doctrin,</hi> That a truly Spiritual wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor is one who poſſeſſeth a ſtock of grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that he may ſupply his Lamp without; he doth not only profeſs but poſſeſs, or this Profeſſor is then in his right frame or order, when it is the fruit and product of the heart. It may be ſaid of a truly wiſe Profeſſor, as <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 8.10. where he counſelleth him to inquire of the aged and experienced Perſon, they (ſaith he) ſhall ſpeak words out of their hearts, that is their own experience, which they have laid up there; as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33055:20"/>one ſaith, the difference between a wiſe man and a fooliſh man is, the Fools heart is in his Mouth, but the wiſe mans Mouth is in his heart; he ſpeaketh from his heart, he keepeth ſomething in whereas the other utters all at once, the wiſe are like <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>My heart is enditing a good matter, I speak of the things which I have made, touching the King, my tongue ſhall be as the Pen of a ready writer,</hi> to this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Wiſdom reſteth in the heart of him that hath underſtanding, but that which is in the midſt of Fools is made known:</hi> alſo the 15.2. and the 16.23. <hi>The heart of the wiſe teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his ſteps,</hi> and after the ſame Language Chriſt ſpeaketh in <hi>Math.</hi> 12.35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treaſure bringeth forth evil things,</hi> ſo in <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.42. you have the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it may be ſaid of a truly wiſe Profeſſor in all his obedience, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all he doth, in ſufferings he doth it from the heart, his prayers, alms, faſtings, and then God taketh it exceeding well when it proceedeth from the heart; ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.21. compared with the 25. and the 29. it is here expreſt five times for their commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they did what they did with a willing heart, all the reſt God taketh little notice of again, read <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.9. <hi>My heart is towards the Governors of Iſrael, that offered themſelves willingly among the people, Abrahams</hi> heart was accepted in offering up. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> herein the wiſe <hi>Virgins</hi> had ſomething that the fooliſh had not, whereby they could bear

Judg Chriſt to tarry or delay: but we may ſee that the true Spouſe of Chriſt apprehends no leſs as we may perceive by the ſcope of <hi>Solomons</hi> Song.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. By all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſw.</hi> By all muſt be underſtood both wiſe and fooliſh, thoſe that had Oyl as well as thoſe that had none, as well thoſe that had it in their Veſſels as the reſt, only there is a difference between a poor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33055:22"/>and a rich man ſleeping, a rich man as we may ſay can better bear it, though the wiſe ſleep yet they have a ſtock, though they ſleep, yet their heart is awake, as in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>What is this ſlumbring and ſleeping?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be intended a natural ſleep, but this ſleeping beareth a clear reſemblance with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſleep, a Spiritual ſleeping is a general ceaſing from all action, and motion; <hi>while the Bridegroom tarried they all ſlumbered and ſlept,</hi> we have three Doctrines in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Jeſus Chriſt in his ſecond coming, cometh under the conſideration and relation of a Bridegroom, to his Church and people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Jeſus Chriſt the Churches Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, ſeemeth in her apprehenſion to be ſlow in his motion in his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the great prevailing evil in the latter days amongſt the higheſt Profeſſors is ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and ſleeping, a drowſie frame attends Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in the latter days.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Doctrin, That Jeſus Chriſt in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming comes to his Church and people as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Bridegroom; in the management of which Doctrin I ſhall endeavour theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Prove this Doctrin from other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Shew you what is wrapt up under this conſideration and relation to the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Lay down ſome diſcovering Characters of thoſe Perſons who may comfortably expect Chriſt as their Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, apply the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt ſhall come as a Bridegroom to his Church and people, is propheſied of and held out in Scriptures elſewhere, ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 62.5.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33055:22"/>
                     <hi>For as a young man marryeth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee; and as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Brîde, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee:</hi> that is, (ſay ſome) thy Miniſters or thy Magiſtrates ſhall marry thee to God, our old reading is this, ſo ſhall God marry himſelf to thy Sons; and if we mind the ſcope it cannot intend no leſs, ſee the next words, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee; the State of the Church is a State of Marriage; this (may ſome ſay) was as to the State of the Jews in their return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſw.</hi> It is more general: See what the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>For I am jealous over you with Godly jealouſie, for I have espouſed you to one Husband, that I might preſent you a chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Chriſt:</hi> ſo alſo in the 5.30. we have the ſame relation owned to them, and this is plain. <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made her ſelf ready,</hi> ſo alſo ſee the Verſes after the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But what doth this relation carry in it to the Saints who are concerned in it? firſt in general it muſt needs be a very bleſſed day; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it a day when a poor Drudge or Slave were to be Married to a Gentleman of a vaſt Eſtate, with dear love and affections on his ſide, nay to a Prince, doth not the thoughts of ſuch a change with ſuch advancement raiſe and ſatisfie her concerned, nay raviſh her heart with unſpeakable joy, it breaks her ſleep, what more particularly is contained in this conſideration; there are in this Marriage ſix priviledges which muſt needs render it a moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate to the true Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is a day of clearing all doubts, diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33055:23"/>all fears of breaking off, or miſcarriages, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, we know according to the metaphor in wooing time, there remains abundance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Virgin</hi> have a good proffer, or one commeth to gain her love, yet how often doth breaches hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in that ſtate? nay ſome after they are made ſure, as we (call it) leave each other, and if they are worth having, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at fears and doubts poſſeſſeth the heart thereupon? Oh! how fearful is the woman that he ſhould take diſtaſt and leave her, inſomuch as thoſe who look on (or themſelves) cannot tell whether it, will be a Match or no; now therefore there is no way to ſecure all, but by Marriage: that puts all out of doubt, ſo in this Caſe this day of Chriſts ſecond coming, to ſuch as are ſincere: it diſſolveth all their doubts and fears, and according to the worthineſs of the Match, ſo are theſe fears deſires and ſatisfactions augmented; this Marriage day muſt needs be a day of bleſſed conſequence, therefore St. <hi>Pauls</hi> care for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was that he might preſent them to Chriſt, he is not at reſt in his though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s concerning them, though they were Eſpouſed, yet afraid leaſt Satan ſhould occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a breach, ſo as not to enjoy the Marriage as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. The ſame care he had for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> 1.28. <hi>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Marriage day is the day of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of love, wooing time is a time of ſecret love, few can take notice of that, few knoweth that there is ſuch love between them; it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what love God beareth to his Spouſe: before, nay they themſelves do not many times know it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33055:23"/>therefore that day is called the day of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Sons of God, as in <hi>Rom</hi> 8.19. <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> and this manifeſtation is promiſed to them that overcome, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Shall know that I have loved thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A day of very great honour. The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. That Marriage is honourable, and if any Marriage be honourable this muſt be ſo, very honourable in reſpect to the Spouſe, here is riches and honour and rule wherewith ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, Jeſus Chriſt doth inſtate her into that glory and rule that himſelf hath, ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit down with me in my Throne; even as I overcame and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a day of great ſplendor and glory as to Ornaments, ſhe that hath lain among the Pots ſhall now be covered over with yellow Gold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.13. <hi>Though ye have lain among the Pots, yet ſhall ye be as the Wings of a Dove, cover'd with Silver, and her feathers with yellow Gold,</hi> ſhe ſhall be glorious and ſplended in her apparel as Chriſt ſhall be, ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.1. <hi>VVho is this that cometh from Edom with died Garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel; travailing in the greatneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is ſtrength, I that speak in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave,</hi> ſo ſhall ſhe be as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13, 14. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within; her cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in raiment of Needle-works; the Virgins her companions ſhall be brought unto thee,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. compare that with the 21.2. <hi>And I John ſaw the holy City, New Jeruſalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33055:24"/>a Bride adorned for her Husband;</hi> we know wedding Cloaths are Ornamental in publick Weddings.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It will be a day of publick and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, not only within but without; we know great joy with Inſtruments of muſick attends Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.34. ſetteth out a time of joy by the voice of the Bridegroom, and the Bride; it is uſuel in thoſe Feaſts to have great joy outward and inward, as you may ſee in <hi>Iſaia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> 62.5. compared with <hi>Zephaniah</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will ſave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging;</hi> that this day of Chriſts ſecond perſonal coming, will be a day of great joy, we may gather from our Lords words in <hi>Mathew</hi> 9.15. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 2.19. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride-Chamber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them? No, it is improper,</hi> ſee <hi>John</hi> 16.22. <hi>And ye now therefore have ſorrow, but I will ſee you again and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you.</hi> So in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Let us be glad, and rejoyce, and give honour to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It ſhall put a compleat univerſal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual end to all ſorrow this day occaſions, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat deliverance from ſorrow, all tears ſhall be wiped away from all faces, ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35.10. <hi>And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to to Sion with Songs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads, they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſighing ſhall flee away,</hi> compare that with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 51.11. alſo 65.19. <hi>And I will rejoyce in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and joy in my people, and the voice of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33055:24"/>weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying,</hi> all ſorrow ſhall flee away: Theſe are the Priviledges attending this Bridegrooms coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But who may wait comfortably for this day with good hope?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer in ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that know and are acquainted with Jeſus Chriſt, it is altogether neceſſary that thoſe that expect Marriage one from another, are acquainted and intimately acquainted with each other; if thou doſt not know Chriſt, it is in vain to expect Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to him, for his coming will be to thee as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to know Chriſt is a matter of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, See <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>And this is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> It is life eternal to know him, to know his Name, his Nature, his Eſtate, his Glory and Dignity, that he is the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such as are ſatisfied in the love of Chriſt may thus expect him with comfort, it is neceſſary that thou knoweſt that he loves thee, in order to this Marriage: and not only that he loves thee, but that thou loveſt him, and indeed it is a ſure way to know that Chriſt loveth us, if we love him, as in <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> This was alſo eminent in the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He brought me to the Banquetting houſe, and his banner over me was love;</hi> ſhe ſeeth his Bed or Chariot paved with love, as in <hi>Can.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He made the Pillars thereof of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the bottom thereof of Gold, the covering of it of Purple; the midſt thereof being paved with love for the Daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> and in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.10. <hi>She concludeth that ſhe is her beloved's, and that his deſire is towards her,</hi> this ſhe is ſenſible of, this ſhe feeds
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33055:25"/>upon, that her beloved I veth her, this St. <hi>John</hi> is ſenſible of, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe who may expect Chriſt with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, muſt be ſuch as are ſure to him, ſuch as are Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed to Chriſt, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 2. <hi>For I have Eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to one husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> thou canſt remember a time when Chriſt and thou were made ſure, (as I may ſo call it) a Match concluded I am my beloved and he is mine, and each member can ſay the ſame; Marriage is but a publick Solemnizing, what before was more privately agreed: It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Father of Chriſt, that they were Eſpouſed before Marriage, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 1.8. They were Eſpouſed before they came together, and we know it is uſual ſo to do; now is Chriſt and thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, thou art in a hopeful way then to Marriage, thou art the perſon that Chriſt comes to as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, his coming is thy Marriage-day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Such as have experience here of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intercourſe between Chriſt and them, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Letters uſe to paſs between lovers between Eſpouſals and Marriage, there uſe to paſs Letters of intimate love and affections, heart loves out goings, there is a communion in Spirit, in Prayer, Reading, Hearing, in Ordinances, that was St. <hi>Johns</hi> ſtate 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe that are ſure to each other do not uſe to ceaſe writing to each other, or viſiting till Marriage day; and thy thoughts have been runing out after him, as his after thee.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:33055:25"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Such as may expect Chriſt as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, are ſuch as look and long for his coming, for this Marriage day, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>So Christ was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation:</hi> So alſo the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Make haſt my beloved; and be thou like to a young Hart upon the Mountains of Spices;</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Surely I come quickly, Amen, Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Such as are preparing and making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for ſuch a marriage, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tting Garments ſutable; is it like that a poor Maid can be married to a Prince in her old and own cloaths? no, Chriſt will have thoſe that he is married to, to have all new, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. <hi>And to her was granted that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and white; for the clean Linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I have two words from hence,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To thoſe who are yet in their ſins and not engaged in their affections, our work is to woo for Chriſt, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſaedors for Chriſt, as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech you, we pray you in Chriſts stead, be you reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God.</hi> Oh, Chriſt is willing to treat with you about this matter; be not diſcouraged by reaſon of your meanneſs, for Chriſt is willing to be at all the Charge to fit you for this Marriage. Oh come poor ſinner, treat with Chriſt and cloſe in with him that you may not periſh.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Art thou eſpouſed? Oh admire at this great condeſcenſion to accept of thee in ſuch an eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Have a care of doing any thing to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33055:26"/>diſoblige him or diſpleaſe him who is ſo worthy of thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be filled with joy in believing and hope of this day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Make all ready, Garments, Oyl, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; we now proceed to the ſecond Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>Second Doctrin, which is this, That the ſecond coming of Chriſt is attended with ſeeming delays, or long tarryings, this is ſuppoſed or taken for granted in the Text; ſome are of opinion that this tarrying is the time between the firſt and ſecond Coming, or his Aſcention and ſecond Coming, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the time of eſpouſal and marriage, or rather after converſion to Chriſts ſecond coming; but if we well weigh and conſider the Context, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes going before, it appeareth otherwiſe, and that it relates to that time immediately before Chriſts ſecond coming, when thoſe ſigns ſhall appear, that are to precede his ſecond coming, according to the 24 Chap. of <hi>Mathew; Then ſhall,</hi> this Emblem be and it muſt be ſuppoſed that before this eminent and remarkable paſſage ſhall appear, there will be many alarms, and a great noiſe of it, <hi>as have been ſome years ſince in England;</hi> now this tarrying muſt intend the time beyond this general expectation of him; now the ſlowneſs of motion in this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, occcaſions this Language of tarrying: it is ſaid <hi>Math.</hi> 25.19 <hi>after a long time the Lord of thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cometh and rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then cometh ſudden deſtruction; Lightning is ſudden in its act, ſo is a Theif, there is a tarrying, and not tarrying, as in <hi>Hab.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>For the Viſion is yet for an appointed tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now in the proſecution of this Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall explain what this ſleep is, and how it is underſtood in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Prove the Doctrin, that this is the overſpreading evil of the laſt days.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall give you the reaſons why it is ſo.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, Make the uſe of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall open the nature of this evil, (called) ſlumbring and ſleeping; Indeed this Language our Lord ſpeaketh, to our capacities and in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; he doth not in this mean or intend natural ſleep; that is no evil, Chriſt himſelf is found in that, as you may ſee in <hi>Math.</hi> 8.24. <hi>And behold there aroſe a great tempeſt in the Sea, inſomuch that the Ship was covered with the waves; but he was a ſleep:</hi> it is no more evil to be found ſo ſleeping, then to be found eating and drinking; but by ſlumbring and ſleeping in Chriſts fence here, muſt be underſtood of the in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, A word that ſetteth forth ſleep in general.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Slumbring is more external than internal, ſlumbring is contrary to deep ſleep; in ſlumbring the thoughts may be awake and at work, but in deep ſleep the thoughts are aſleep alſo; of this ſlumbring ſtate muſt the Church be underſtood, when ſhe ſpeaketh as you may read in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. or <hi>Solomons Song, ver.</hi> 2. in theſe words, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh; it is the voice of my be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, A perſon in ſlumbring is (as to himſelf) ſenſible of the length of time, and thinketh the time longer than it is; whereas in a deep ſleep he is not ſenſible, but thinketh the time ſhorter than it is; it is certainly true, that a Perſon in a ſpiritual ſleep, a deep ſleep, is not ſenſible of the length of time he lyeth in that ſecure quiet eſtate, till ſome eminent diſpenſation of affliction awaketh him.</p>

                  <p>Now that this evil of ſlumbring and ſleeping will prevail in the latter days, a little before the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt, will appear,</p>

In theſe words, <hi>Therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober,</hi> by this it doth appear that there was Sleeping in that day according to the fence of the Text before us; but what may be the reaſon of the prevailing of this evil in the latter day?</p>
                  <p>Firſt it may ariſe from the abounding of formal external Profeſſors in thoſe days, (I may ſay) many are aſleep becauſe never truly awaked, only rowſed, not raiſed from death, or to ſtand up from the dead: there are many that are ſtartled, and ſeared, afflicted, and convinced, but not thorougly converted and awakned and raiſed up from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e dead, (as the Apoſtle calleth it.) We read that while St. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned of righteouſneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33055:30"/>and judgment to come; <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, but we hear no more of him, he was not thorowly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened nor raiſed up, to this agreeth what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Profeſſors amongſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing evils of the latter days, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Theſe words having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof, from ſuch turn away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ariſeth ſometimes from former wakefulneſs and induſtry, it is obſerved that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a more than ordinary zeal and induſtry, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves and ſoon fall a ſleep, of this ſort were the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſpoken of, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and how thou canſt not bear them which are evil, and thou hast tryed them which ſay they are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and are not; and haſt found them lyars. And haſt born, and haſt patience, and for my names ſake haſt laboured and haſt not fainted. Nevertheleſs, I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love:</hi> this people had laboured much, 'tis twice expreſt, we find four qualifications which did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the drowſie and ſleepy ſtate of this Church, which is expreſſed by the Spirit of God in that place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They were choicely induced with the grace of patience in affliction, 'tis twice expreſt in the Context.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They were not only patient but active, they laboured, as is twice expreſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They could not bear with evil in their members or teachers, which was a choice qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They held a long time in this State; therefore it is added, and haſt not fainted, yet after this induſtry ſhe fell a ſleep, ſhe left her firſt love,

                  <p>Firſt, The remarkableneſs of it: it is uſhered with a Behold as it is elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Four times we have it added to or uſhering in his coming, as thoſe things that are of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which call for more than our ordinary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are brought in with a Behold, as I may ſhew you thorowout the whole Scriptures; and it is no wonder, though this appearance of Chriſt be uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Behold, for it is a remarkable paſſage upon a fivefold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the tranſcendent incomparable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Perſon in that day; this is that which Perſons are called to behold: One glorious in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel is an object of obſervation, this occaſioneth the Church to cry, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.1 <hi>Who is this, that cometh from Edom, with died Garments from Boz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength?

                  <p>Fourthly, It calleth for a Behold from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that wrath and anger he appeareth in, in that day; this day is called the day of wrath, yea of

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33055:35"/>
                  <p>Firſt, He cometh when Perſons leaſt look for him, the <hi>Virgins</hi> did not look for Chriſt at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet Chriſt chuſeth that time to come in, as is plain from <hi>Math.</hi> 24.43. <hi>But know this, that if the good man of the Houſe had known in what watch the Thief would come, he would have watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would not have ſuffered his Houſe to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up. Therefore be you ready, for in ſuch an hour as you think not, the Son of man cometh:</hi> ſo likewiſe in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. you have the ſame words. <hi>Be ye therefore ready alſo, for the Son of Man cometh in an hour that ye think not:</hi> alſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33. <hi>Take ye heed; Watch, and pray, for ye know not when the time is:</hi> it is foretold to be in ſuch a juncture of time, as you may further read in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>For when they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſuddain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When Chriſt is ſaid to come at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, it implies a very dark time as to a Viſion, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.6. <hi>Therefore Night ſhall be upon you, that ye ſhall not have a Viſion, and it ſhall be dark unto you that ye ſhall not divine, and the Sun ſhall go down over the Prophets, and the day ſhall be dark over them.</hi>

                     </gap> true then that Chriſt thus cometh, what may be the Uſe of this Doctrin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Then give not way to ſpiritual ſleep, though in the Night, nay though Midnight; foraſmuch as Chriſt may come in that hour; we know not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may come at Midnight, cock-crowing, or dawning of the day: it is natural for Perſons to ſleep in the Night one would think, but in this ſenſe we muſt have a care of giving way to this ſleep though in the Night; Chriſt was offended at his Diſciples that they were aſleep, though in the Night, at that time when he was to be betrayed, ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 26.42. <hi>And he came and found them aſleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Uſe,</hi> Oh what a dreadful time will that be to wicked men, Enemies to Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with this circumſtance of time; Condemned perſons amongſt us have a Bell rung at midnight, the night before Execution, and how ſad and amazing is this to thoſe concerned alarms of War, or fire is dreadful in the night eſpecially at midnight, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſts coming is at midnight.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing to be ſpoken unto, is the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt appropriates to himſelf, and that is a Bridegroom: the Bridegroom cometh not, now the Lord cometh though that is true. I ſhall but touch this head becauſe I have ſpoken to it before; yet I will ſpeak a few words with reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he cometh tranſcendently glorious in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, Bridegrooms uſed to be adorned, as in Iſaiah, 62.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my Soul

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Even as a Bridegroom he cometh with his heart and face filled with tender affections, and conjugal love, with arms open to receive his deareſt ſpouſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He cometh with his heart and face filled with wrath and revenge to thoſe that have been her Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Firſt, Then the ſpouſe of Chriſt hath no cauſe to be afraid of Chriſts ſecond coming, the true ſpouſe of Chriſt may ſay of him in his appearance, as the <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 25.9. <hi>And it ſhall be ſaid in that day, loe, this is our God, we have waited for him and he will ſave us, this is the Lord we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation.</hi> From this ground it ariſeth, that the Primitive Saints are ſo deſirouſly waiting for Chriſt, as in 1 Cor. 1.7. <hi>So that ye came behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Alſo 1 Theſſ. 1.10. <hi>And to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raiſed from the

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:33055:37"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, If Chriſt ſo come, then let none deſire his coming under this conſideration, but anſwer it in preparation, for the Bride muſt be anſwerable in her adorning to the Bridegroom, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13, 14. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within, her Cloathing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in raiment of Needle work, the Virgins her companions that follow her ſhall be brought unto thee.</hi> Alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>Let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready, and to her was granted that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linnen clean and white: for the fine linnen is the righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come now to the fourth thing conſiderable in the explication of this Text, and that is the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Proclamation that ſhall be made at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and the great queſtion will be, who makes this cry, the <hi>Virgins</hi> being all aſleep? Some are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that the Miniſters who are yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awake, ſtanding upon their Watch tower make this Cry.</p>
                  <p>But it is moſt probable that this voice is from Heaven, for ſo we find it all along in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> which relates unto this day, all theſe alarms are from Heaven, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.1, 2. <hi>And after theſe things I ſaw another Angel come down from Heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory, and he cryed migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily with a ſtrong voice, ſaying,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird.</hi> The Prognoſticks againſt Babylon calling out Gods people is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. where we have a relation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33055:38"/>of this very Coming of Chriſt as a Bridegroom it is from Heaven, read the words <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.5. <hi>And a voice came out of the Throne ſaying, praiſe our God all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him both ſmall and great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of this Doctrine. See the care that our Lord hath, that he would not ſurprize his Diſciples; the Lord doth afford awakening means to the very day of his coming, even in thoſe dark midnight diſpenſations there ſhall be a very great clamour or Cry, for it muſt needs be very loud that ſuch effects follow, as to awake thoſe that are ſo ſecure and dead aſleep.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing to be ſpoken unto is the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, go ye forth to meet the Bridegroom: but ſome may ſay, did not they go forth before, they took their Lamps and went forth to meet him, I anſwer yea, they did go forth before but by their ſpiritual ſlothfulneſs and ſleep, they were reduced to their former eſtate, and wanted now an Invitation again to go forth, this was the eſtate of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> though they were once quickened by the grace of God, as in the <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickened who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins:</hi> yet this people after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was called upon to awake out of ſleep, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. you may thus read, <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi> Alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent and do thy firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candleſtick except thou repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are not only to go forth but to this end to meet the Bridegroom, Chriſt doth expect his ſpouſe ſhould come to meet him in his coming,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33055:38"/>and not to ſit ſtill till he come; we know Kings and Embaſſadours are uſually met and brought in by the people; the Saints are ſaid to be caught up to meet the Lord in the Air, as in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Then we which are live and remain, ſhall be caught up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall we be ever with the Lord:</hi> there is a twofold meeting the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By reformation, as we muſt underſtand it in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael,</hi> that is, by reformation and amendment of life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a perſonal meeting under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a proper ſenſe, ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.16. <hi>And the Lord m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, To riſe up from ſecurity in which a Perſon lyeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To go from our injoyments.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To go to meet a Perſon of high eſtate, there is required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, To meet in this ſenſe, is to fall in and come along with him; ſee 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.14. and alſo <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Behold the Lord cometh, and all the Saints with thee:</hi> thus much as to the ſixth Verſe.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Their ſelfiſh reaſon given, we muſt ſupply or ſerve our ſelves firſt: <hi>Nabal</hi>'s anſwer to <hi>Davids</hi> Servants will ſerve in this caſe, ſhall I take the Oyl that I have provided for my ſelf, and give it to you? No.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is harſh as to the ironical advice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, conſidering the time it was given in, there was none then to be had; they ſerved thoſe as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſerved <hi>Baals</hi> worſhippers, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.27.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth thing conſiderable, is the advantage of the wiſe, they are ſaid to be ready, having a ſtock by them, they went in with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:33055:39"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, We have the full relation of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of the fooliſh <hi>Virgins,</hi> in three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The door is ſhut againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the ſucceſſleſs allegation of their profeſſion and acquaintance with Chriſt, which was with great confidence, if we compare <hi>Math.</hi> 7.23. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.27. <hi>But he ſhall ſay unto them, I tell you I know you not whence you are, depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have Chriſts poſitive denial to open the door, with the reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, We have in theſe Verſes our Lords application of the whole Parable, in a general uſe of exhortation to the duty of watchfulneſs; as if in effect our Lord ſhould ſay, You my Diſciples take notice, all theſe evils have (or ſhall) happen for want of this great duty of watchfulneſs, for the beſt of theſe and the wiſeſt had enough to do to be ready to go in with Chriſt, now of each of theſe eight particulars I ſhall briefly ſpeak a few words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The actions and tranſactions of theſe both wiſe and fooliſh in order to their Lamps, in which circumſtance we have four Emphatical words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, aroſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, trimmed.</p>
                  <p>This then hath reference to the time of the cry in Verſe the ſeventh; it implies the ſpeedineſs of this addreſs, there is no delay when this alarm is given, neither will it admit of a delay, for Chriſt is ſwift in his motion, in his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33055:40"/>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the univerſality of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, (all,) the fooliſh as well as the wiſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein, as all ten fell aſleep, ſo all ten are awakened by this Midnight cry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They aroſe, not only awaked but aroſe, ſtood up: the word here is often and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in Scripture uſed to ſet forth a reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The buſineſs they ſet upon when thus raiſed, the Text ſaith they trimmed their Lamps or Candles; for Lamps and Candles are taken one for another, as you may ſee in the margent, where Candle is read. We read in Scripture of two ſorts of Lamps, burning bright and ſhining Lamps, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 62.1. <hi>For Sions ſake I will not hold my peace, and for Jeruſalems ſake I will not reſt, until the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof as a Lamp that Burneth.</hi> Compare this with St. <hi>John</hi> 5.35. <hi>He was a burning, and a ſhining light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light,</hi> ſuch was St. <hi>John</hi> in his converſation, and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We read of a deſpiſed Lamp, as in <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. <hi>He that is ready to ſlip with his feet is as a Lamp deſpiſed in the thought of him that is at caſe,</hi> that is, an old ruſty Lamp without light or Oyl, what is that good for? it is of no eſteem, the fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> Lamps are deſpiſed Lamps, according to what <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, in <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. of no worth nor uſe, for what uſe is a Lamp of, if not to hold forth light? The great incumbent work of the <hi>Virgins</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake is to (trim) their Lamps: the word trim in Scripture hath a four fold acceptation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To adorn or beautifie, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. Whoſe adorning.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33055:40"/>
                  <p>Secondly, It is taken for to garniſh, ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly to prepare or trim is all one; thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sometimes it is called dreſſing, we read in Scripture of dreſſing the Lamps, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7. Alſo we read of dreſſing feet in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. Now to dreſs or trim a Lamp implyes two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to draw up the wiek to make it burn clear.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To pour in Oyl to ſupply the root; from whence it is ſaid they had Veſſels beſides their Lamps, I ſhall note from the words thus opened, theſe four things or Doctrines obſervable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Doctrine that ſpiritual drowſineſs, ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, and ſleeping doth dammage and ruine our profeſſion, weakeneth our Lamps or lights, the Lamps run to ruine while they were aſleep, inſomuch that they now want trimming.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Doctrine, That the Lamps of the beſt and wiſeſt profeſſors want trimming.</p>
                  <p>The Third Doctrine, a Chriſtian is in no fit caſe to meet Chriſt but with a trimmed Lamp.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Doctrine, That it is the property of a truly awakened Chriſtian to concern himſelf about his Lamp, ſo as to have it adorned, garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prepared, and dreſt: or thus, A Chriſtian is no Chriſtian without good light, good light is eſſential to a true Chriſtian. I ſhall wind up this ſeventh verſe with a few words to each of theſe, I hope you carry along in your minds, that by the Lamp in the context is intended the converſation; and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this light muſt be divided into two parts, the inward and the outward; the inward light is faith and love, the ſenſe of Gods love, theſe all do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33055:41"/>decay whilſt the Spirit of ſleep is upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the light of converſation, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alſo is liable to dimneſs, contrary to what our Lord calleth for, in St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Let your lights ſo ſhine that men ſeeing your good works may glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven:</hi> if this be the effect of this ſleep, have a ſpecial care to watch againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The Second Doctrine. The Lamps of the beſt of Saints want trimming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.17. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. The Church of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtirs up <hi>Timothy,</hi> to trim his Lamps, while he bids him ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ir up the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ft given him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> from bence, by way of inſtruction: It doth not therefore follow that a Chriſtian hath no light, becauſe it doth not burn clear; it is poſſible it wants trimming.</p>
                  <p>The Third Doctrine. None are fit to meet Chriſt but ſuch as have trimmed Lamps: therefore no ſooner do theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> hear the noiſe of the Bridegrooms Coming, but they fall to trimming. We have a remarkable place for this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Let your loines be girded about, and your lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye your ſelves as thoſe that wait for the Lord.</hi> But that little time I ſhall ſpend, ſhall be upon the Fourth Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Fourth Doctrine That a truly awakened Chriſtian is to inquire into, and inſpect the State of his Lamp, or Light. In handling of which Doctrine, I muſt have an eye to Light within, converſation without, grace in the heart, holineſs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. An awakened ſoul muſt ſee how it is within, what light is there; and that there is, or ought to be light within is hinted in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.10. the Prophet there ſpeaks of one that ſits in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33055:41"/>and hath no light; this light muſt reſpect his faith and full aſſurance, the Face of God is called light, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us;</hi> this <hi>David</hi> who was truly awakened ſeeks after, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>restore thy free Spirit unto me:</hi> this is that light which <hi>David</hi> went into the Sanctuary to obtain, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.17. ſee what the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> unto, in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8. in oppoſition to ſleeping, <hi>But let us who are of the day be ſober, putting on the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of faith, and love, and for an helmet the hope of Salvation:</hi> a wakeful Chriſtian muſt have all right within; and if this be not our great care, it is a ſad ſign we are not truly awakened.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This light reſpects the Converſation, and ſo our Lord expounds it in the aforeſaid place, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine;</hi> Chriſt hath ſet his Diſciples as lights in the world, Chriſtians therefore are to ſhine forth; ſee the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us walk ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as in the day;</hi> alſo ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. as the fruits of Perſons awakened and ſtanding up from the dead, he exhorts them, <hi>to walk Circumspectly, not as fools, but as wiſe; Redeeming the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the days are evil:</hi> all which reſpect Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwerable to our Text, as wiſe <hi>Virgins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt, This may ſerve to diſcover to us, that the life and work of a Chriſtian is not as many take it to be; a work done at once for all.</p>
                  <p>Some are ready to think that if their Lamp was well lighted at firſt, there needs no more care about it, but we ſee it is not ſo; there ſtill wants trimming, daily adorning, preparing, garniſhing, and feeding this Lamp, and ſupplying it; Lamps
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33055:42"/>muſt have attendance, care and pains taken with them; have a ſpecial care of truſting to your firſt trimming, and repleniſhment.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Conſidering the divers acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of this word in Scripture of trimming, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doubtleſs what <hi>Titus</hi> exhorts Servant in his ſecond Chapter and tenth Verſe, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all Sexes and relations; he exhorts them to obey and pleaſe their Maſter well in all things, as in the ninth Verſe, to this end that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things God requires that we ſhould garniſh our Lamps or Profeſſions, as ſome do Candleſticks.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Conſider the near approach of our Bridegrooms coming, and from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, let us be exhorted to ariſe and trimm, and make ready to meet him; which that you may do, obſerve four or five rules of direction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seriouſly conſider and ſtudy your formet experiences, in the days of your firſt acquaintance with Chriſt; how ſweet his love was then to your Souls, how readily and comfortably you could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt then.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In a Land not ſown, this God calleth to remembrance, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.2. I remember thy love in the thine Eſpouſals, this is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles would have the Hebrew Church to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>But call to remembrance the former days in which you were illuminated, how you then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a great fight of affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to ſtrengthen your love to Chriſt, a Perſon rightly trimmed to meet him as a Bridegroom, hath his heart ſtrong in love: thoſe that trul, wait for Chriſt, are thoſe that love him,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33055:42"/>as we may eaſily perceive and gather by comparing <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.4. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. that which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls waiting, the Apoſtle calleth loving Chriſt; the ſame promiſes that are to thoſe that wait for Chriſt, are to thoſe that love Chriſt alſo; ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. compared with 2 Chap. and 5 ver. But how may I know whether I love Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By Chriſt's own rule, If thou keep his Commandments, as in <hi>John</hi> 14.21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thou loveſt the Saints and Brethren, that ſheweth that thou loveſt Chriſt; as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to ſtrengthen and refreſh thy faith in Chriſt's ſecond coming, and thy intereſt in him; by faith we ſtand, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>By faith we live;</hi> as in the 10 Chap. and 38 ver.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Labour to get looſe from preſent things, without which we cannot ſtand ready; this is the girding up of our minds, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To effect this, be much in ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication, which of all means is the moſt effectual in order to the fitting us for Chriſt's ſecond coming, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36. <hi>Watch, and pray alwaies; that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the Son of Man:</hi> thus I have done with the ſeventh Verſe.</p>

               <div n="8" type="verse">
                  <p>We come now to the eighth Verſe. <q>
                        <hi>And the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe, give us of your Oyl, for our Lamps are gone out:</hi>
                     </q> Before I come to ſpeak to this Verſe, which is a Diologue between the wiſe and fooliſh <hi>Virgins;</hi> I ſhall by the way take notice of the appellation upon theſe <hi>Virgins,</hi> (fooliſh) which word hath an affinity with the Hebrew <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> ſignifying ſapleſs or unſavory, (as the <hi>Rabbies</hi> tell us,) we have this word emphatically uſed in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33055:43"/>the Old Teſtament, once relating to the Husband of <hi>Abigail,</hi> the ſecond concerning <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife. Firſt of <hi>Nabal,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.25. <hi>Nabal is his name and folly was with him:</hi> he anſwered to his name in theſe four Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As he was a prophane, wicked, covetous drunken, ſottiſh man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As he was a moroſe, railing, abuſive man, he railed on <hi>Davids</hi> Servants, as you may ſee in that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He was an ungrateful Perſon, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred evil for good to <hi>David,</hi> as you may ſee is 21 Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and Chiefly was he <hi>Nabal</hi> or fooliſh, from that he wanted a foreſight, he could not ſee forward, and herein according to <hi>Solomons</hi> words, <hi>A wiſe Mans eyes are in his head:</hi> a fool can ſee but what is preſent, <hi>Nabal</hi> could neither ſee <hi>Davids</hi> preſent power to hurt him, or his future Kingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as <hi>David</hi> ſhould injoy, which his Wife wiſe <hi>Abigail</hi> could ſee; ſhe is ſaid to be of a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and indeed this is wiſdom, to ſee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and provide for time to come; ſee what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.24. there are four things that are little, but exceeding wiſe; and wherein did their wiſdom conſiſt, but in forecaſting for time to come; the Ant, the Cony, the Locuſts, the Spider, all theſe are exceeding wiſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</p>
                  <p>Our ſecond inſtance, is of <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife, who is called a Nabaliſh Woman, as in <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. <hi>Thou speakeſt like one of the fooliſh women,</hi> and wherein did this appear?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In one thing it appeared, in her dulneſs in I arning the Doctrine of godlineſs in <hi>Job</hi>'s family.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:33055:43"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Her profaneneſs and ignorance in her ſpeech to her Husband, Curſe God, and die; not fearing or reverencing God, which is true wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, Her want of foreſight to ſee to the end of Gods diſpenſations, ſhe looked only at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, and things ſeen, which <hi>David</hi> himſelf calleth fooliſhneſs in himſelf, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, even as a Beaſt before him:</hi> ſo that it appeareth, that the principal evil in theſe two, which rendred them by name (fooliſh,) was want of foreſight, (having eyes in their heads,) and this is by our Lord Chriſt given out as the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character between the wiſe and the fooliſh Builders, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 7.24. <hi>The wiſe built on a Rock;</hi> looking forward to duration, the fooliſh on the ſand; and wherein do the <hi>Virgins</hi> in our Text come ſhort, was not this that wherein their folly did appear, they did not lay in a ſtock for duration.</p>
                  <p>Now we return to the words again, Verſe the eighth, <hi>And the fooliſh ſaid;</hi> theſe unſtockt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon a ſpiritual account are the fooliſh in our Text; from whence I note this Doctrine, That it is a Doctrine of the higheſt folly in Chriſts account to be without a ſtock and proviſion by us, in order for time to come, for eternity; a wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Profeſſor, is a ſtockt Profeſſor for time to come; upon an earthly account, a poor man may be a wiſe man, although he hath not a Penny nor a bit of bread before hand; but it cannot be ſo in ſpirituals, poor and fooliſh go together, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.20. there is Oyl in the dwelling of the wiſe, and treaſure deſireable; but a fool in Chriſts ſenſe is a poor ſoul, or that hath no ſtock,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33055:44"/>or that is not rich towards God, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. is a very clear place to this purpoſe, ſo is every one, that is he is a fool, the wiſe woman <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. it one that is richly furniſhed with a ſtock, but how doth it further appear that ſuch a perſon is a fool or fooliſh?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is a fool as he is ignorant of the nature of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.8, 9. underſtand ye fooliſh, theſe unſtockt perſons would ſuppoſe God to be like man, who cannot ſee the Heart what is within.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He is fooliſh as he hath ſlipt his opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to get a ſtock, this is a peice of folly indeed; ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> renders them <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wiſdom, ſeeing he hath no heart?</hi> or rather it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by way of diſcovery that he is a fool, who hath a price in his hand to get wiſdom, and does not improve it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is a fool as he is a hypocrite, who is outwardly ſomething, but nothing within; the whole courſe of a hypocrite, is nothing but a courſe of folly; of all fools the hypocrite is the greateſt fool, and the reaſon is becauſe he taketh a great deal of pains, and reaps no profit by it, he doth in all his profeſſion but play the fool; like Children that make ſhows, he ventures himſelf many times, his credit eſtate and life to no profit; there are none ſin at ſo dear a rate as the hypocrite doth, nor any ſinner ſo diſtaſtful to God as he, nor none ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked as he. Now of hypocrites there are two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt a groſs ſort, who uphold a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on purpoſe to deceive, as thoſe we read of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. who make long prayers to devour Widows Houſes.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33055:44"/>
                  <p>But there is a Second ſort, who in compariſon of thoſe are ſimple and ſincere, but yet ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves, and deſire to deceive others, ſuch are theſe in our Text; but let us know that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of hypocrites is bad and puniſhable. Now we come to the words themſelves, which contains a dialogue between the wiſe and fooliſh <hi>Virgins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, we have the petitionary requeſt of the fooliſh to the wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This requeſt is backed with a reaſon of the petition, give us of your Oyl, their beſt ſhift is now begging; for they neither ask to buy nor borrow, but to give, but <hi>Solomon</hi> foreſeeing their diſappointment, ſaith <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.4. <hi>The Sluggard will not Plow by reaſon of the cold, therefore ſhall he beg in Harveſt and have nothing:</hi> this is the caſe of the fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> in our Text; they gat nothing (give us of your Oyl,) they knew the wiſe had Oyl; formal outſide profeſſors can Judge of ſincerity in others, though they themſelves have none; (give us of your Oyl.) Oh! the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that ſluggiſh lazie profeſſors brings upon themſelves for want of improving time and means.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the aſſerted reaſon rendred by the fooliſh to the wiſe, for our Lamps are gone out, and that in a time of moſt need; their light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here by the Lamps is gone out, extinguiſhed; the light of profeſſion not fed goeth out, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites Lamp or light is not laſting, it fails him when he hath moſt need, at death, or at Chriſts coming to Judgment, nay in time of Trial and temptation, ſuch was the ſtony ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. that the hope of the hypocrite fails him at the giving up of the Ghoſt; or when God taketh away his Soul, an hypocrite at laſt is not only diſcovered to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33055:45"/>others but to himſelf, he ſeeth and ſaith now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> his light is gone out, though it is poſſible ſome may die with hope, and riſe with hope as theſe ſeem to do; yet now in this time of need their hopes fail them. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of the nature of this hope of the hypocrite, as in <hi>Job</hi> 8.13, 14, 15. <hi>So are the paths of all them that forget God, and the hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a Spiders Web or houſe,</hi> in five Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is a compact of curioſity; but no ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Her houſe is formed out of her own Bowels, not fetcht out of the Forreſt or ſtone quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not like the Bee that fetches it abroad; but his hope is grounded upon his own righteouſneſs; ſee the Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. and the duties he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, She uſeth her houſe for a double uſe, to dwell in her ſelf, and to inſnare others, ſo doth the hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, She dwelleth in it with Confidence, ſo doth the hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A Spiders houſe is down with little adoe, the whisk or broom layeth it flat at once, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33.14, 15. an hypocrite ſhall lean upon his houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.15. We now proceed to the application of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By way of Information, it doth inform us that the eternal perdition and excluſion from glory is the fruit of their folly: theſe were fooliſh <hi>Virgins,</hi> it ſeemeth to be Emphatically urged, in this Context, they were not wiſe, ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in ch. 3. ver. laſt. <hi>The wiſe ſhall inherit glory, but ſhame ſhall be the promotion of fools,</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.17. fools be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33055:45"/>of their tranſgreſſions are afflicted: this will greatly aggravate the condemnation of ſinners. But the queſtion will be, is this folly neceſſitated? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. No it appears to the contrary in Scripture; becauſe that God both immediately from himſelf, and mediately by his Servants deſireth the contrary, ſee the Lords ardent and paſſionate deſire, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. <hi>Oh, that my people were wiſe,</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.8. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, O ye brutiſh among the people, and ye fools when will ye be wiſe?</hi> and this is <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſhes throughout the whole book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> all along.</p>

Although as to outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as from outward Judgments, thoſe relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as the family) have received mercy upon their account, (as <hi>Noahs</hi> Family did) yet not eternal good things received upon their account.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Uſe.</hi> Have a ſpecial care of hypocriſie, it is a very dangerous evil, it is a ſin of the higheſt magnitude, it is a ſin that is very diſtaſteful to God, a ſin that Chriſt pronounceth more woes againſt than againſt any ſin, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. (as one calleth them) they are the firſt born of the Devil, and there is cauſe for it; for an hypocrite is moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to God of all, for he renders God as the Idol Gods, that have eyes and ſee not, ears and hear not, they think he ſeeth not their hearts. Chriſt ſeemeth to intimate that hypocrites are the firſt in Hell, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. laſt. <hi>They ſhall have their portion with hypocrites.</hi>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:33055:46"/>

                  <p>A few words to each of theſe, and ſo I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That frugality and covetouſneſs in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals is not only conſiſtent with, but a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of true wiſdom; theſe are the words of the wiſe, not ſo, covetouſneſs which is ſuch a ſin that God abhors that Perſon in whom it is, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. yet in this caſe it is allowable. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts:</hi> though

                     <hi>Jacob</hi>'s dealing with his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe would have been condemned as a piece of uncharitableneſs, yet it is not blamed in that caſe, as the bleſſing and birthright pointed at ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals; therein <hi>Eſau</hi> only is blamed as a fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and profane Perſon, in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 1.2.16.

                  <p>Firſt, They are out of the way when Chriſt came.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The door was ſhut againſt them, which is a dreadful aggravation, for though they had been out of the way when Chriſt came, yet if the door had been left open for them, there had been ſome hope, but the door is ſhut, which beſpeaks their ſtate to be very bad.</p>
                  <p>Second Circumſtance in the Text and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the wiſe, ſetting forth the great advantage of the wiſe above the fooliſh, and that is expreſt in two Circumſtances.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33055:50"/>
                  <p>Firſt it is here ſaid, they were ready.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſaid they went in with Chriſt to the marriage, a ſingular and unſpeakable priviledge.</p>
                  <p>The words are plain and want but little explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only the word Ready: by which we muſt underſtand two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To be ready is underſtood ſometimes to be accoutred, cloathed, and apparelled; thus it is uſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Bride, the Lambs wife hath made her ſelf ready: and this readineſs is in her being array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that fine linnen ſpoken of v.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes readineſs in Scripture, doth import a waiting poſture: thus it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.37. that word watch is termed by the word ready, <hi>v.</hi> the 40. <hi>Be ye therefore ready, is the ſame with, watch,</hi> in the former <hi>verſe.</hi>

                  <p>The Firſt Doctrine, That there is a day and time when all endeavours of obtaining grace and wiſdom will be in vain, and altogether ſucceſleſs; theſe beg of their fellows, they go to buy, and all in vain, yet they are ſhut out.</p>

                  <p>Of each of theſe a few words.</p>

This was the Faith of holy St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Though his converſation was in Heaven, yet he looks for Chriſt his Saviour,</hi> not his own righteouſneſs which he undervalueth in that Chapter greatly.

                  <p>Secondly, A mind girded up is ſixed in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of that glory that ſhall be brought to them at this day of Chriſts appearing: ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.</p>

                  <p>There are five or ſix Circumſtances in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans converſation that give light.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In good works, Charity and alms, liberality to the poor, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes to be the Oyl in our Text, and which the wiſe <hi>Virgins</hi> had, and the fooliſh wanted. I muſt acknowledge according to the ſequel of this Chapter, in the third parable there ſeems to be ſome ground for them ſo to judge; ſee ver. 35, 36. for I was an hungry and ye gave me meat, gives them admiſſion to this glory. But I ſhall not inſiſt upon theſe Scriptures that ſeem to favour that opinion, I ſhall only deſire you to read three or four Scriptures to the purpoſe, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. <hi>And I ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> unto you, make you friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when you fail they may receive you into everlaſting habitations, Luk.</hi> 12.33 <hi>Sell that you have, give alms, provide your ſelves bags that wax not old, a treaſure in heaven, that fails not,</hi> read <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18. read the words and counſel of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven</hi> From all which places we may gather that Charity and good works is a way wherein Chriſtians have their lights burning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our lights burn or ſhine, in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the truths of Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel as opportunity affords it ſelf to us. This is that the Apoſtle calls for from the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 2.15, 16. this is called for to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That wherein our lights ſhine is in a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33055:53"/>circumſpect obſervation of our duties in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relations; every one hath his particular work, Husbands, Wives, Maſters, Servants, Parents, Children, and each in their places do either guid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, Our lights ſhould ſhine forth in out words, there is much light held forth this way as we may gather from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Moderation in all our injoyments, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, cloathing, as to joy and ſorrow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Relations, this doth demonſtrate a Perſon rightly waiting for Chriſt; thoſe who are waiting for Chriſt, muſt not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As to the proof of this Doctrine I ſhall name but two Scriptures, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.44. <hi>Be ye therefore ready:</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Be ye alſo ready, for the Son of Man cometh in a day when ye loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth our Lord require this readineſs? I anſwer in general for our good, and the equity of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We muſt be ready from conſideration of the ſuddain and ſwift coming of our Lord, <hi>Mala.</hi> 3.2.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33055:53"/>
                     <hi>The Lord ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple: Mark</hi> 13.36. <hi>

We read of a certain Creature who if he ſeeth a man, before the man ſeeth him, it is deadly; it is true in this caſe, for if we are not waiting for Chriſt and ready for him at his coming, it is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for Chriſt to come at unawares, or when you look not for him, is very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Third <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Chriſt may well expect from the time he gives to make ready, and he expects an improvement of time, according to time given, as he did of <hi>

                  <p>Sixth <hi>Reaſon.</hi> There is no one thing, wherein we ſhew our love to Chriſt more than in being ready; and rather waiting for him than Chriſt for thee. I ſhall cloſe this with a word of Uſe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Be exhorted to make ready for him, have nothing to do when Chriſt comes, whether by death to thee, or in Perſon.

A few motives to ſet home this Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider the dreadful ſtate of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that though many are called, yet but few are choſen, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.14. <hi>None choſen but ſuch as are ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider how well our Lord taketh it to be ready, as appears by his Carriage to ſuch, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider how reaſonable a requeſt it is to be ready, when he is at all the coſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. Thus I have done with the tenth Verſe.</p>

               <div n="11, 12" type="verse">
                  <p>The eleventh and twelfth Verſes. <q>
                        <hi>Afterwards came alſo the other Virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe two Verſes we have wrapt up the perfect and total diſappointment of the fooliſh <hi>Virgins.</hi> We had the beginning of their miſery in the former Verſe, which lay in this that the door was ſhut upon them, that was a tacite or implicite rejection; but here we have their poſitive and declared rejection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their irrecoverable diſappointment, they are wholly denied and rejected in their vehement ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations for entrance.</p>
                  <p>In theſe two Verſes we have contained two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral parts.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The Lords reply unto them.</p>
                  <p>But in our handling theſe two Verſes, I ſhall glance at theſe two parallel places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. becauſe they ſeem to relate to the ſame time,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33055:54"/>and are ſpoken to the ſame Perſons, or ſuch like, ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 7.22. <hi>They will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name, cast out Devils, and done many wonderful works?</hi> we have Chriſt's reply, ver. 23. <hi>And then will I profeſs I never knew them, depart from me ye that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iniquity:</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25, 26, 27. <hi>I tell you I know you not, depart from me ye workers of iniquity:</hi> ſo in our Text, <hi>Verily</hi> or <hi>Amen, I know you not:</hi> ſo that in taking in thoſe Scriptures, we have not only a petition to the Lord to open, but many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments urged to move the Lord for entrance, but all in vain. In the petition we have conſiderable,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The matter of the requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have in this petition the manner of it conſiderable, we have the ingemination or doubling of the word, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> which ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath theſe four Circumſtances in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Confidence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Earneſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Intimacy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſidence in oppoſition to baſhfulneſs, ſhame, or ſilence, it is a commanding authoritative ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſavours of earneſtneſs and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of ſpeaking, quickneſs of ſpirit in ſpeaking, willing to be quickly heard and taken notice of; as when Chriſt ſo ſpeaks to <hi>Martha, Luk.</hi> 10.41. <hi>Martha, Martha:</hi> and ſo it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that voice from heaven to <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Saul, Saul:</hi> the Lord is earneſt and would be heard.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This kind of ſpeaking implieth intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and acquaintance, it is that kind of ſpeaking
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33055:55"/>which intimate friends uſe to each other, Chriſt and <hi>Martha</hi> was familiar, and to this purpoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke given by Chriſt, <hi>

                  <p>Fouthly, It implies acknowledgment, as if he ſhould ſay, thou art my Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſhall ſay <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> we own thee as our Lord; thus it muſt be underſtood <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. we ſay <hi>Abba</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> by way of acknowledgment, ſee <hi>John</hi> 20. <hi>My Lord, my God:</hi> ſo that we ſee the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition hath much in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we take in the forenamed two Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we find a material Plea with ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We have five arguments uſed here with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of opening and entrance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (ſay they) we have eaten and drunk in thy preſence: this eating and drinking in Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is taken two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For eating perſonally with Chriſt, when he was on earth, as <hi>Judas</hi> and many more bad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By ſome it is taken for eating and drinking at his Table in the Church, and this latter is moſt likely, becauſe Chriſt was aſcended before this flocking in of the <hi>Virgins;</hi> beſides there are but few can plead the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou haſt taught in our Streets, that is, we have been Sermon-hearers; by hearing Chriſt may be, under ſtood hearing his Miniſters, ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If you have heard Christ, and have been taught b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> him:</hi> which there can not be underſtood Chriſt in Perſon, but his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They had not only heard but taught
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33055:55"/>themſelves, if propheſying be preaching as many underſtand it to be, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They had caſt out Devils poſſibly by faſting and prayer: caſting out Devils is not enough; therefore Chriſt caurions his Diſciples not to rejoyce in that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Nevertheleſs rejoyce not in this that the Devils are ſubject to you, but rejoyce your names are written in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fifth argument theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> urge is, that they had done many other mighty works. Now all theſe allegations and Pleas we may ſuppoſe are true, for our Lord never contradicts them as not being true, and theſe are conſiderable arguments, what not let in ſuch, ſo qualified, and ſo related to Jeſus Chriſt? this ſeems ſtrange to them, they made no queſtion but theſe arguments would have opened the door; but inſtead thereof, ſee our Lords ſharp angry reply in two circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His abſolute poſitive rejection of them, depart, depart, no admiſſion, notwithſtanding all this. And this rejection is built upon a double founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He knoweth them not, which ſeems ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They were workers of iniquity, and that is ſtrange alſo conſidering what they pleaded here.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe Doctrines that I ſhall obſerve from the words thus explained, ſhall reſpect not only this Text, but thoſe parallel places forenamed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Doctrine, That Perſons are naturally and ſtrongly apt to lean, bear, and lay weight upon the external duties of obedience. Theſe ſeveral pleas are all outward, not a word of any thing inward, all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ward; this was the Plea of the Jewiſh Church
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33055:56"/>with God all along, they leaned upon the Lord from that ground, this was natural with the Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. <hi>I faſt twice a week.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Doctrine. The beſt of duties reſted in are nauſeous and abominable to God, ye are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity, yet we read of no groſs evils recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them. This truth is very much confirmed in Scripture, ſee <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>My ſoul hateth your ſolemn meetings, incenſe is abominable to me, Eſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Their Sacrifices are like offering Swines blood, cutting off a Dogs neck,</hi> and ſuch kind of Language.</p>
                  <p>The Third Doctrine, That perſons may be in the higheſt duties of obedience and yet workers of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Doctrine, That workers of iniquity may have a ſtrong confidence, Faith and knowledg in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Doctrine, Boldneſs and confidence is not alwayes a ſign of a good eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth Doctrine, A wicked or a reprobate perſon may be inabled by the Spirit of God, to do great things in his name.</p>
                  <p>The Seventh Doctrine, It is a very hard matter to perſwade perſons that Chriſt does not know them. See what pains Chriſt takes to beat them off, I tell you, I profeſs, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe obſervations are worth our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and improvement as they are drawn from theſe Scriptures joyntly conſidered: but thoſe which I purpoſe to inſiſt upon are ſuch as do naturally ariſe from theſe verſes alone, which are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Doctrine from the words, That ſome unprepared and unwiſe perſons, ſhall be vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous and paſſionately ſolicitous for life and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33055:56"/>Salvation, when too late. See the pains theſe perſons take after their awakening.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They apply themſelves to the wiſe for Oyl.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They go to buy Oyl.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They come to Chriſt though the door is ſhut, yet this doth not diſcourage them, they come with confidence as if they could command en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, need makes them to ſeek with pains, like ſome condemned perſon, begging Cordially for a pardon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Doctrine, May not this ſerve for a Land-mark for us to warn us to ſeek in earneſt, and make ſure in a proper time and ſeaſon? Oh! come improve your little time and ſeaſon, conſider how ſad it will be to fall into this ſtate, as theſe in our Text, ſeek early and earneſtly in time before it be too late, take <hi>Solomons</hi> counſel, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. <hi>What thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might,</hi> for the ſame reaſon he gives there, thou canſt not do it in the grave nor after the grave.</p>
                  <p>The Second Doctrine, That many high profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſhall ſuffer a great and total irrevocable diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, contrary to ſtrong expectation, at Chriſts appearance; perſons may live, die, riſe in ſtrong hope, and yet their hope deceive them. But what may be the ground and reaſon of this diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Miſtaking thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of the qualifications upon which Salvation is built, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Scriptures too narrow that ſpeak of Faith, as if bare believing were enough without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful effects of Faith in purifying the heart and life, not taking in ſuch Scriptures, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the heart by Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every

                  </p>
                  <p>We now proceed to the third Doctrine, That
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33055:57"/>the great ground of Chriſts rejecting perſons from glory with him in the laſt day, lyeth in his not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; I know you not, I profeſs I never knew you; it will be a ſad and dreadful ſtate at that day not to be known of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In handling this Doctrine I ſhall ſpeak to theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What it is for Chriſt to know a perſon in that day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Shew you how a perſon may now know in himſelf that Chriſt will know him then.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Chriſt to know a perſon, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a bare knowledge, for ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he knows all both good and bad, even their hearts are known to him; he knows what is in man, <hi>John</hi> 2.25. but to know here muſt be underſtood, to approve, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem a perſon with reſpect, and ſo it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.8. <hi>There aroſe another King that knew not Joſeph,</hi> that is, had no favour for him; and thus the World is ſaid not to know the Saints, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. In this ſence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> know their Preachers, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>know them:</hi> and thus God is ſaid to know the Godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. thus God is ſaid to know <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>For I know him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For God to know, is for him to take care and make proviſion: thus Chriſt is ſaid to know his ſheep, <hi>John</hi> 10.14.</p>
                  <p>But how may a poor Soul know in himſelf now, that Chriſt will know him in that day?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Ask thy ſoul this queſtion; doſt thou know Chriſt? they that know him, ſhall be known of him; it is a matter of great concernment to know Chriſt rightly, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal to know Chriſt, as we ought to know him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:33055:58"/>
                  <p>But how ſhall I then know that I do know him?</p>
                  <p>Anſ. Firſt, if thou knoweſt him as thy Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If vve know him rightly, vve knovv him as our King, vve obey his Lavvs, that is more than ſaying, Lord, Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith he knoweth him and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To knovv Chriſt, is to ovvn him in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; the contrary, is to be aſhamed of him, and vvill incur Chriſts being aſhamed of ſuch at this day, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thoſe that knovv Chriſt, knovv him in his members: for a perſon to ſay he knovvs Chriſt and not to knovv his Saints, is inconſiſtent; they that knovv not the Children of God, are emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called the World. Chriſt takes vvhat is done to his members, as done to himſelf, as appears <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. And theſe are of thoſe that Chriſt knovvs. There is more in love to the Brethren, than in caſting out Devils, to oblige Chriſt to knovv thee.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Such knovv Chriſt vvho keep Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vvith him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. and this Communion is greatly maintained by cordial and ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If thou knovveſt Jeſus Chriſt, that knovvledge tends to holineſs, in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>without holineſs none can ſee, much leſs know God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. ſuch as vvork iniquity cannot be ſaid to knovv him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See of what abſolute neceſſity knowing Chriſt is here in order to a hopeful expectation of Chriſts knowing thee at the day of his coming in Glory: labour therefore to know and be acquainted

                  <p>We are now come to the concluſion of this firſt parable which contains Chriſts application of the whole upon his Diſciples. In this verſe, we have contained two general parts.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall explain this ſo great and uſeful duty of watchfulneſs, I ſhall ſhew you what our Lord means by this duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you how want of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was the foundation of the deſtruction of the fooliſh <hi>Virgins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Shew you ſome reaſons why Chriſt and his Apoſtles do ſo much call for this duty in Goſpel days, and the more as the time draws near.</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33055:59"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Lay down ſome Characters of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I ſhall endeavour to preſs our Lords uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of exhortation upon Chriſtians in this day.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, what watchfulneſs is in it ſelf; the word here tranſlated watch is <hi>(excito)</hi> to ſtir up or a waken; the loweſt acceptation of watchfulneſs is wakefulneſs, in oppoſition to ſleeping, to keep the eyes open is a ſort of watchfulneſs. This is plain from Chriſts words to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. when he found them thus ſleeping, watch ſaith he, that is, keep your natural eyes open. This watching I dare not exclude in our Text, for if there may be exceſs in eating and drinking, ſo alſo there may be in ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in giving way to drowſineſs and ſottiſhneſs. This <hi>Solomon</hi> inveighs much againſt in his Proverbs, <hi>love not ſleep leſt thou come to poverty, Prov.</hi> 20.13. and this watching I dare not exclude, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.31. to the elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, therefore watch, and remember that by the ſpace of three years I ceaſed not to warn you every one night and day with tears.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> had broke his ſleep to perform his duty to the Churches, and this he offers as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for them to imitate. And this we know is the courſe of the world in earthly concerns; they riſe betimes, and go to bed late, ſometimes their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle goeth not out by night, as we read <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.18. of the induſtrious and prudent woman; now we are to ſeek for wiſdom, as for ſilver, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4. break our ſleep for it; ſilver ſeekers do ſo. We have the example of our Lord upon this account, who roſe up a great while before day, upon a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>Silas</hi> did ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. From hence the falſe Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have their Vigils, their Night Watchers; and of this watchfulneſs ſome have experienced much ſpiritual profit, when the heart hath been in it; and I am ſure if Perſons are reſolvedly ſet for grace and glory, they would find need of this watching. But I ſhall bend my ſelf to ſpeak to the watchfulneſs of the inward man, as being the principal end, that without which the other cannot profit. There is a ſpiritual and inward ſleep taken notice of in the Scriptures, ſome of which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures I ſhall cite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. <hi>It is high time to awake out of ſleep. Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, stand up from the dead.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> all which Scriptures muſt needs relate to the inward watchfulneſs I ſpeak of; this ſleep is when our ſpiritual ſenſes are aſleep: for as the natural body hath its ſenſes, ſo the inward man hath his ſenſes according to <hi>

There are five ſenſes relating to the inward Man, Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Feeling, Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I ſhall but name this, becauſe I touched upon it before. This watchfulneſs conſiſts in three Circumſtances.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Obſervation; where the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eye and affection are looking out, this is wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alting;</hi> that is, obſerve: thus it is ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:33055:60"/>watched to kill St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, ſought opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A watch implies induſtry, exerciſe, uſe of means; thus it muſt be underſtood of the Maſter of the houſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.43. <hi>He would have watched, and not ſuffered his houſe to be broken:</hi> he would have been awake; both exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his weapon to defend and offend: barely keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes open, would not have hindred his breaking in; watching is an induſtrious work; ſee how St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Watch, yea ſtand faſt, quit your ſelves like men, be ſtrong:</hi> ſo alſo to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Watch thou, and indure affliction;</hi> theſe go together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Watching ſuppoſeth expectation, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt looking out with longing, thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. which I have touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5, 6. <hi>I wait for the Lord;</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting are the ſame many times in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Thus I have briefly opened the nature of this duty of watchfulneſs, it is a wakeful, obſerving, induſtrious, expecting frame of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that I am to ſpeak unto is this, How this want of watchfulneſs was the foundation of the miſcarrying of the fooliſh <hi>Virgins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſw.</hi> That the foundation of their miſcarriage did not conſiſt in not opening their eyes, but in the want of a painful uſe of means, herein they were ſhort; they were ſlothful in a time of harveſt, when they might have furniſhed themſelves; they fought when it was to late: and that this was the ground of their miſcarriage, will appear plainly from the next Parable; the whole ſcope whereof is to incourage induſtry before Chriſt come; the Oyl, the Wedding Garment is the fruit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33055:60"/>theſe fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> had not been in good earneſt for heaven, with violence and with their might, they did not ſeek wiſdom as for ſilver, if they had, they ſhould have found, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>They that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Perſons ſeeking the world and earthly things may miſs, though they ſeek early and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; yet thoſe that ſeek the kingdom of heaven ſo, ſhall not miſs of it; we have many promiſes to that.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Why is this duty of watchfulneſs ſo much called for, and preſt in Goſpel days?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt foreſaw, this would be wanted when there ſhould be moſt need; and that ſlumbring and ſleeping ſhould prevail greatly in ſuch a day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe then the coming of Chriſt draws near, that was the argument the Apoſtle uſeth to awake the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 13.12. the near approach of their ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe our great adverſary is more than ordinary vvatchful in thoſe days, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Becauſe he hath but a ſhort time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The latter days are full of ſnares, gins, traps, and temptations to catch ſouls; novv this duty rightly performed in conjunction vvith pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is the only means to antidote a ſoul from thoſe ſnares, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.35, 36. <hi>For as a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watch therefore and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth thing I am to ſpeak to in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33055:61"/>of this Doctrine, is to lay down ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a vvakeful Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A vvakeful Perſon taſtes much ſweetneſs in the promiſes of God, as a healthful man can taſte his food. As an unregenerate man, ſo a declined ſleepy Profeſſor is a ſtranger to the covenants and promiſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. they are to him as food to one whoſe heart is aſleep. When <hi>David</hi> was in a lively ſtate and frame of Spirit, ſee how ſweet was the contemplation of future promiſes to him, ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. ver. 18. to 22. ſo alſo Chap. 25.5. <hi>He hath made with me a ſure Covenant ordered in al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> things: David</hi> feeds on the promiſes as a hungry man doth upon his food; and indeed God hath given out many precious promiſes to the end they might be ſtrong conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A watchful wakeful Perſon is ſenſible of the leaſt ſin, though but in thought; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is tender, can feel the leaſt prick of ſin; whereas one aſleep can bear great ſins inſenſibly: ſin to a lively heart is like poyſon in a <hi>Venus</hi> glaſs, it cannot entertain it, he hates the Garment ſpotted with the fleſh, he hates the very appearance of evil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A vvakeful Perſon is conſtant in duties, he keeps true ſtroke, his works are perfect; one in a drowſie and watchleſs ſtate is not conſtant in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an Hypocrite or drowſie Profeſſor doth not pray always nor keep to duty always. The Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> when her works were not perfect, ſhe had need to be exhorted to watchfulneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Be watchful and ſtrengthen the things which be ready to die, for I have not found thy works perfect before God:</hi> a Perſon aſleep ſtrikes imperfect ſtrokes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A watchful Perſon holds faſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33055:61"/>in the outward ordinances of Chriſt as his Garment; a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erſon drowſie or aſleep lets fall his Garment, the Spirit of God makes watching and keeping the Garment cotemporary, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Be watchful and keep thy Garment:</hi> when <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was aſleep he had dropt his Garment and lay naked in his Tent.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A watchful Perſon experienceth increaſe of ſtrength againſt his own iniquity, ſo did <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 18. he is ſeldom overcome by them, this is the means that Chriſt directs unto <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, A wakeful Perſon delights in lively ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Company and Society, it is his great delight to be in their Company; whereas a drowſie Perſon is burthened with them: But I would but touch theſe things becauſe I ſpake ſomething to this particular before.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the fifth particular which is to preſs this Uſe of exhortation upon Chriſtians. Would you not be repulſed at the laſt day, as theſe were? then here lyeth your duty, which is to watch, be in good earneſt, do your work ſure. Which if you would be found effectually in it, you muſt watch and obſerve narrowly three enemies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Devil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The World.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Watch your ſelves, and that in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What we do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What we ſay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What we think.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us weigh our actions by the balance
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33055:62"/>of the ſanctuary; the deeds of the body muſt be taken notice of, for there is great danger, if not good deeds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. we live or die accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, <hi>If we through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, we ſhall live; if we live after the fleſh, we ſhall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt narrowly watch our words, remember what Chriſt ſays, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.36, 37. <hi>Of every idle word men muſt give an account:</hi> by their vvords they ſhall be juſtified or condemned. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prays for Gods help herein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3. <hi>Set thou a watch before my Mouth, keep the door of my Lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt obſerve our thoughts, they are not free as ſome ſay; no, herein lyeth part of our fitneſs for Chriſt in girding up our minds or thoughts, as you have heard from <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. the heart is to be kept with all diligence, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi> 3.24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt obſerve Satan; it was the commendation of the Churches that they were not ignorant of the depths and devices of Satan, and it is our duty to be ſtrong in Gods might againſt him; this is that we are exhorted to, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt be circumſpect in our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this preſent evil world, which alſo is a great and prevailing enemy to the Saints if not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly vvatched; ſhe hath a double influence upon us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By threatnings and frowns.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By her ſmiles and allurements; both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, which made <hi>Agar</hi> pray, <hi>That he might have neither poverty nor riches,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were both ſnares, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong ones have fallen by this enemy; and that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33055:62"/>Satan might tempt our Lord himſelf prevailingly, (this is his great temptation,) <hi>Math.</hi> 4. he ſhews him the Kingdoms of this World and the glory of them, with promiſe to give them if he would worſhip him: doubtleſs Satan thought he could not chooſe a likelier means to deſtroy the Lord of life; though the Lord Chriſt was well able to deliver himſelf from the power of it, yet many are conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdued by this allurement: We read of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> an eminent Preacher of the Goſpel, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is taken hereby, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having loved this preſent World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Secondly, I would preſs this Uſe of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by Chriſt, from his own argument, <hi>For ye know not the day nor hour when the Son of Man ſhall come:</hi> certainly this is a conſideration that Chriſt would fain faſten upon his Diſciples minds in order to the duty of vvatchfulneſs, and therefore we have it repeated over again and again, you may ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 24. three times in that Chapter, ver. 36. <hi>But of that day and hour knoweth no man,</hi> ver. 42. <hi>Ye know not what hour your Lord doth come,</hi> ver. 44. <hi>In ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Mark</hi> 13.32, 33. This is a ſecret lockt up in the breaſt of the Father alone, this is not known to Angels, no not to Chriſt himſelf, but the Father only, ver. 36. therefore when Chriſts Diſciples would have known the time, Chriſt only gives them predictions and forerunners, not a preciſe time; and when the Diſciples asked Chriſt again, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. it is not (ſaith he,) for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath kept in his own hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why may not Chriſts Diſciples know
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33055:63"/>the day and hour, and why is it ſo inculcated upon them as aforeſaid?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he would not have perſons pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, God would not have man to pry into this ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Chriſts Second coming, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> things belong to God,</hi> this is one of them. There hath been a double evil amongſt men in the Apoſtles times concerning his coming, ſome put the day too far from them, as thoſe 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. others brought it too near, as thoſe 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. now to prevent both, our Lord would not have us buſie our ſelves too nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about it, telling of us, the knowledg is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is thus reiterated and inculcated, the uncertainty of Chriſt coming, that we might always be ready for it; this is the ſcope of our Text, therefore perſons in general have their deaths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, that they may with <hi>Job, all their appointed time wait till their change come.</hi> The Thief doth not uſe to tell when he will come, which calleth upon the houſe-holder to be always ready, and provided for him, which is Chriſts Argument to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not Chriſt ſeem to intimate, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.30, 31, 32. that his diſciples may as eaſily know his coming and day, as the Husbandman may know when Summer is near?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, he may know the ſeaſon in general, not the day or hour; ſo a man that grows grey may judge death is near, but he knows not the day nor hour, nor you neither, in which he ſhall dye: ſo we in like manner may judge our Lords coming is not far off this day, by thoſe forerunners which are as the grey hairs preceeding a mans death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> We have two things implyed in this verſe.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:33055:63"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt comes, when he cometh, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he comes, he comes as the Son of man: the conſideration of both which may be profitable to us that we may ſo look for him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As coming ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As coming as the Son of man. So I have done with the thirteenth verſe and with the firſt Parable.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord Jeſus was much affected with this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical ſpeaking when he was on earth: we find him laying down eight Parables in one Sermon of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. if we take in one omitted by <hi>Mat.</hi> taken in by <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.26. and indeed he was ſo frequent in this kind of ſpeaking that it is ſaid, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a parable ſpake he not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.34. and he knevv this vvas a profitable ſpeaking, no vvay like this to inſinuate and command the Judgment and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33055:64"/>ruled him and overcame him. Every Parable is made up of three Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Rind or bark, the vvord in vvhich it is ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The root and occaſion of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The moral and application of it, vvhich is the chief thing that vve are to inquire after in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Parable, vvhat it teacheth us.</p>
                  <p>We are novv come to our Lords ſecond Parable, contained in this Chapter, vvhich is the Parable of the Talents, repeated alſo by <hi>Luk.</hi> chap. 19. And this Parable ſeems to riſe from a double root; if vve take in <hi>Luke</hi> vvhich is a Parallel place to this: in <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. Chriſt ſeems to anſvver to a ſecret thought ariſing in their hearts from ſomevvhat fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken by our Lord, from vvhence they gathered that his Kingdom ſhould immediately appear; ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.11. vvhich to take off he tells them he muſt firſt take a great Jouney to receive it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking this Parable according to our Context <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. the great ſcope and deſign of it is, to provoke to induſtry in his abſence. If any ſhould queſtion or be at a loſs in themſelves, for what cauſe the fooliſh <hi>Virgins</hi> were excluded, Chriſt doth in this following Parable powerfully aſſert, that the ground of their loſs and diſappointment lay here, that they did not improve the ſtock committed to them to trade with, for idleneſs, not for ſpending but hiding what thy were intruſted with. (<hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi>) Theſe words are not in the original in moſt Copies extant, yet it may be judged a rational and neceſſary ſupplement becauſe it agrees with the firſt verſe of this Chapter, and is the preface of moſt other Parables, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.

                     </gap>y becauſe I have ſpoken to it before, upon ver. 1. and partly becauſe it is not in the original Text.</p>
                  <p>We now proceed to the words which are a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in this Parable we have eight circumſtances conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Journey taken.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, We have the houſe ſet in order, for his abſence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have the behaviour of his Servants in his abſence.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We have the return of the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The reckoning called for by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The reward of the induſtrious and faithful.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, The ſevere puniſhment of the ſlothful Servant.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the conſiderable parts of this Parable which I ſhall ſpeak unto as I proceed.</p>
                  <p>But before I come cloſely to this Parable, give me leave to inquire into theſe four things relating to this Parable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who is this man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is this Journey.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, What are the Talents or goods.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. It is agreed on all hands, that this man is Jeſus Chriſt who is called the Son of man in the verſe before, and frequently in Scripture is ſo called. Chriſt in his judging the World is a man, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. the man Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>

                  <p>3 <hi>Vſe.</hi> Know this, that what rules and orders Chriſt gave to and left with his Church, is for the whole time of his abſence; and he looks to find his houſe in the ſame order he left it in, when he went away: therefore in the two great Ordinances of the Goſpel, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, we find their Period at Chriſts return at the end of the World. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you in Baptizing to the end of the World.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Lords death till he come:</hi> the Church and houſe of Chriſt hath its being in all Ages, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.21. therefore if you have an Ear to hear, you are to hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Church in this day, as well as formerly in that day immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his Aſcenſion to Heaven: know this, that all the viſible power that Chriſt hath in the World at this day, is only that power he hath in his Church; and know alſo (whatever you may think,) that the Church is the only receptacle of Perſons in order to happineſs and glory hereafter: Chriſt gathers from thence thoſe that ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rewarded, and enter into their Maſters Joy: well, Chriſt is yet upon his <hi>Journey,</hi> but his return draws near. So I have briefly done with the 14 and 15 Verſes.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The Journey taken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The end, to receive a Kingdom.</p>

                     </gap> Journey.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The carriage and behaviour of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in his abſence.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Lords return.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The account required.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The reward given to the induſtrious.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The certain reward given to the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Caſt him into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> ver. 30. I have already ſhewn from the former heads, that our Lord Chriſt did at once at his going away, ſettle his houſe in ſuch order as he would have it abide in, in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and requires to find it when he comes again. Now in this fourth head, we have a relation (Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall) from Chriſts Infallible foreſight and knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the proceedings and carriages of his Servants (his own peculiar Servants) when he is gone, as to the improvement of their Maſters eſtate in their hands; that they kept houſe is taken for granted, they did not throw the doors off the hooks and diſſolve houſe keeping, this is not by Chriſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33055:69"/>they will do in his abſence, but they kept his houſe, and their evil was that they were not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally faithful and induſtrious, ſome were eye Servants, and were lazy in their maſters abſence. As in the former Parable we find in one Society wiſe and fooliſh <hi>Virgins,</hi> ſo here in his houſe ſhall be found faithful and wiſe, ſlothful and fooliſh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as afterwards we find Goats amongſt the Sheep, and muſt be ſevered when Chriſt himſelf the great Shepherd ſhall come. Our Lord himſelf who knew what was in man, intruſted ſome who afterwards proved very bad, idle and ſlothful, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unbelieving.</p>
                  <p>We know that amongſt Chriſts Servants, in his abſence, amongſt his twelve there was one intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who was unfaithful, <hi>Judas</hi> by name, <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> a wicked covetous perſon, a Son of perdition? This preface may teach two ſorts of perſons, two leſſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe who are obſervers of Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do not condemn the Church or houſe of Chriſt, becauſe there are bad perſons in it; a very good Maſter may have very bad Servants, eſpecially in his abſence; it is no certain rule to judg the way by the perſons that own it, no though Preachers there may be ſuch, it is not ſufficient to judge by: you read <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. in the Parable of the <hi>Drag-net,</hi> there are brought in bad and good, and the time to ſever, is when the Lord comes, who ſhall reveal the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To Church members, Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, this conſideration may ſerve to awaken and rouze them to inquire into their eſtate, and not to truſt to their Church memberſhip, as if that would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33055:70"/>ſecure them. Some eſpecially Preachers are apt to think they are owned and approved by God to be faithful, becauſe intruſted with the work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we ſee that ſome that propheſied in Chriſts name, caſt out Devils, are condemned by him to the loweſt place and ſevereſt puniſhments. Before I come to ſpeak to theſe three verſes, I ſhall explain two words in our Text, Firſt, what is here to be underſtood by trading.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What by money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſ.</hi> Firſt in general, the whole is a Parable, the deſign of which is to ſet out Heavenly things by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore it is no wonder, though Chriſt ſpeaks like men in earthly affairs, of money and trading.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is taken for bodily labour, the word (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) tranſlated, traded, is drawn from a Root that ſignifies buſineſs, buying, ſelling, nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating in merchandizing, and commonly taken for merchandizing, for it is not ſo properly labour of body, though ſometimes ſo taken, as labour, of body and mind: but as I ſaid before it is moſt properly taken for buying, and ſelling; ſo taken in <hi>Joſephs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his Brethren, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.32, 33. <hi>their trade hath been in Cattel,</hi> or as the <hi>Heb.</hi> men of Cattel; ſuch as bought, ſold, and bred up Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; ſuch as we call Graſiers: ſo <hi>Eze.</hi> 27. it is plain that buying and ſelling in Fairs, is called trading: So it muſt be underſtood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. <hi>All that trade by Sea.</hi> So that when Chriſt ſaith here, they went and traded, he alludeth to Traffick, to profit, not only labour as a Horſe, or fool, but continuance in it with deſign of mind, to gain. Our Lords great deſign in theſe three verſes is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and ſtir up his Servants to induſtry: the word money is derived from (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But for our more orderly proceeding, I ſhall ſumm up the whole in theſe three verſes, into theſe five Doctrines.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Doct.</hi> That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a trade going, and managed in his abſence, <hi>he went and traded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> All Chriſts good and faithful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Servants are traders, or Merchant men, men of buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Doct.</hi> That Chriſts trade, the Heavenly trade well managed, turns to great profit, to Maſter and Servant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Doct.</hi> All Chriſts gifts or <hi>Talents,</hi> are given for uſe, as well the leaſt as the greateſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Doct.</hi> There are ſome of Chriſts own intruſted Servants, who do not improve what they receive.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Doctrines I ſhall paſs by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken to it before; only remember I then ſpoke of it, as Chriſts appointment, but now as their anſwer; they went and traded: theſe are faithful, and are found following their Maſters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as we have it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> That all Chriſts faithful acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are traders. This appears becauſe they are all liable to account.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, buſineſs, freedom of trade imports Commerce with a correſpondent at a diſtance, we have liberty of trade as Freemen. That which I ſhall firſt do in proſecution of this Doctrine, ſhall be to ſhew how a true and faithful Servant of Chriſt, when he is as Chriſt would have him to be, doth ſitly reſemble the higheſt ſort of traders, Merchants in ten particulars.</p>
                  <p>A true Servant of Chriſt bears reſemblance to the higheſt ſort of traders in ten circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He knows the worth of the commodity he trades in; what ever others do that are out of the way of that trade, he well knows the worth of the Pearl, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.46.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He is ventureſome, not timorous and fearful in laying out his money in that Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the skilful Merchant is as free and willing to lade his Ship as he is to unliver it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is endued with patience, to wait the return of a long Voyage; he doth not repine bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſe his Ship to the <hi>Indies</hi> doth not return in Five or Six Months; he hath patience to wait for a good, and bear a bad return; he doth not knock off trading becauſe he hath had a loſs, though great; but goeth on ſtill in his trade: from hence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33055:71"/>it is that the trading Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.17. is ſaid <hi>to have her loins girt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> ſtrength, ſhe is not afraid of the Snow or Cold, ſhe is armed for it,</hi> ver. 21.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The higheſt ſort of traders many times ſtraiten themſelves to inlarge their trade, ſtraiten their home occaſions, to venture large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afar; he takes up goods, borrows mony to caſt upon the waters, to ſend out of ſight for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Of theſe Merchant we read in the Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.44. ſelleth all he hath, to purchaſe the hidden Pearl, and ver. 45, 46. the Merchant, <hi>that hath found one Pearl, ſells all he hath to buy it.</hi> The Pearl is at a diſtancee; yet a true Merchant, a trader ventures for it: a true Chriſtian Servant of Chriſt, may bear the name of the higheſt ſort of Traders Merchants, ſo called in the former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Great Traders are accuſtomed to and acquainted with truſting, they trade for time, three Months, ſix Months, nine Months, they trade upon Credit or Faith; and ſuch great Traders have a way of inſuring what they venture: this is their refuge, I will (ſay they) inſure; and let me ſay this to Chriſtians, no trade like Chriſts trade for truſting, no trade ſo ſure as to its returns: here Men have need ſometimes to inſure their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers; they need not do ſo who trade heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, their inſurer is able and faithful.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, As the higheſt Traders deal in large quantities of the Commodity, fill Ware-houſes, and whole Ships: So the Trader under Chriſt deals large, large in his endeavours, large in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, aims, and expectations. When <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of that Merchant Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. he ſpeaks of her as compaſſing great things; ſhe conſiders and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33055:72"/>buys a Field, <hi>She plants a Vineyard:</hi> ſhe is not content only in her lower domeſtick affairs, but lanches out abroad.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, As the higheſt of Traders, ſo a Trader under Chriſt trades at a great diſtance; he findeth that it is moſt profitable in its return, though long: an <hi>India</hi> Voyage ſaith the Merchant, is better than three or four nearer Voyages; a Chriſtian drives his trade at a great diſtance in Heaven. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of thoſe Traders, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>his Converſation, his Trade,</hi> (as the word will bear) <hi>is in Heaven:</hi> It is ſaid of the former Merchant Woman, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. ſhe fetcheth her food from far.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, As the higheſt ſort of trades on earth to forreign parts at a great diſtance, have their Correſpondent there, who trades there in their behalf, who negotiates for them in their abſence, and ſends them their effects and products: even ſo a Chriſtian that trades in Heaven, hath his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent there who is acting there for him, even Jeſus Chriſt who is entred into Heaven for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, All this trade is driven with mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and deliberate counſel, they muſt be wiſe men that drive this great trade, ſuch as through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience are incouraged, ſuch (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Who have their eyes in their head,</hi> a fool will not be a Merchant adventurer, he loves to ſee what he hath before him.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, This trade thus driven brings in great profit. Are not thoſe Merchants moſt rich who trade largeſt and furtheſt? this trade for Chriſt brings thirty, ſixty, or a hundred fold in return. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſometimes makes <hi>cent. per cent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:33055:72"/>
                  <p>There are three choice commodities that Chriſts intruſted Servants trade in, vent and venture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Making known the truths of Chriſt in the Goſpel in order to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Charity and Alms.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sufferings for Chriſt, and the Goſpel. Theſe are ſtable commodities, which being rightly managed, never fail of a profitable return.</p>
                  <p>A word or two to each of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A word or two to the <hi>Talent</hi> of knowledge in the Scriptures; and indeed I might be large upon this head, were I not deſigned to be brief in the whole.</p>
                  <p>Now though all Chriſts Servants are not intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike herein; yet I am perſwaded that there is not one living member of Chriſts houſe that is not intruſted with ſome meaſure of this kind, namely a word that might be profitable, though women: <hi>Priſcilla</hi> as well as <hi>Aquila,</hi> capable to inſtruct an <hi>Apollos, Acts</hi> 18.26. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ch. 2. indefinitely exhorts them <hi>to ſhine as lights, and to hold forth the word of life,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. exhorts <hi>as many as had received the gift, he ſhould miniſter therein.</hi> The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth all had not received alike, yet each had ſome gift of this kind which ought to be brought forth as occaſion is offered.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Talent</hi> is of great uſe to the world right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed. It is true that ſome are by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God called to larger opportunities, yet each at one time or other have an opportunity, if they have a heart to ſpeak, ſomething in order to the inlightning the World, and there is a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them to expreſs their Charity to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not to hide this <hi>Talent</hi> in a <hi>Napkin.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ipoken firſt what they had to ſay. And ſee how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable this modeſt forbearance was to God, <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> is not in the leaſt blamed, he was no forwarder.</p>
                  <p>There are two extreams amongſt perſons in this reſpect, ſome will not declare what they know, no not at any time, either out of too much modeſty, or elſe from fear of diſpleaſure from thoſe they ſpeak unto.</p>
                  <p>Others there are that are too forward and prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical to thruſt forward themſelves, when they are not juſtly called to it, but poſſibly the matter might be better managed by others;</p>
                  <p>If we would therefore manage and improve our <hi>Talent</hi> rightly to Gods glory, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</p>
                  <p>We muſt obſerve theſe rules in our ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be ſure thou ſpeak, when if thou doſt not ſpeak for God and truth, none elſe will. It was a proverbal ſpeech amongſt the Hebrews, Where there is not a man, there be thou a man: which may be applied to this caſe, when truth will ſuffer if they be ſilent, be ſure thou ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When thou openeſt thy mouth to ſpeak, ſpeak from the honeſty and ſincerity of thy heart, not from the height of thy Spirit, not out of pride, and vain glory, but from theſe ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To inſtruct the ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To reduce thoſe that are out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To feed thoſe that are hungry.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To ſtrengthen thoſe that are weak.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:33055:74"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, To confirm thoſe that are feeble and doubting.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, To comfort thoſe that are ſorrowful.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, To incourage thoſe that are fearful.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, To provoke thoſe that are ſlothful.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, In all to gods Glory.</p>
                  <p>When theſe are thy ends in ſpeaking, or any one of theſe; it is a ſign of an honeſt heart.</p>
                  <p>There are grounds that commonly hinder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons improving this Talent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Slothfulneſs and idleneſs, not willing to trouble themſelves</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Baſhfulneſs, ſhamefacedneſs, want of heart and courage, this is as bad as being too forward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some out of fear leſt they ſhould bring themſelves into trouble or procure ill will to themſelves from others: <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11. alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>He will teach and tell what God hath done for his ſoul:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one <hi>that declared the whole Counſel of God,</hi> not fearing what might follow: ſo did St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John, Act.</hi> 4. <hi>We cannot but speak what we have ſeen and heard:</hi> for we were not born for our ſelves, or intruſted with life for our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. no man <hi>liveth to himſelf:</hi> If any of us be inſtructed with knowledg in the truths of Chriſt, we are intruſted with a Talent, and the Maſter expects the improvement, that he may receive his own with uſury.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Talent to be improved is Riches; with them we are to trade for Heaven: a Servant of Chriſt trades in charity, and alms; Charity to the Poor is fraighting your Ship to Sea a long Voyage for great advantage: <hi>Solomen</hi> calls this, caſting thy Bread upon the Waters, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Caſt thy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33055:75"/>bread upon the face of the waters, and after many days thou ſhalt find it:</hi> and that to great advantage, which he expounds ver. 2. to be giving a Portion to ſeven and eight. The Merchant caſts his eſtate upon the face of the Waters; this is the trade that our Lord adviſeth to, under the Parable of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Steward, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. So doth the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. it is a trade that brings certain and large profit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Suffering for Chriſt and his truth, is a Talent that ſome are called to trade in: and Chriſts chiefeſt Servants have a Talent given them in this kind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe, but to ſuffer for his ſake:</hi> (it is given to you,) and he that gives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects improvement of this gift, and not to hide it for fear. Theſe three are the ſtable Commodities that Chriſts Servants venture in; and they all turn to a rich account, which brings me to the ſecond Doctrine which was this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> That this Trade for Chriſt well managed, turneth to great profit and advantage to Maſter and Servant.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine I only make uſe of as a Motive to the former: in handling this Doctrine I ſhall Firſt, Prove the Doctrine. Secondly, Inſtance in particulars. Thirdly, Anſwer a Queſtion as to the time of this return. Fourthly, Apply the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For proof, we have it ſet forth in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Five Talents make Ten, according to <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. One Pound makes Ten. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. is true, <hi>The Merchandiſe hereof is better than the Merchandiſe of Silver or Gold;</hi> that is ſo ſay, in the increaſe of it. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Tim.</hi> 4.8. is true here, <hi>Godlineſs is great gain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:33055:75"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To inſtance in particulars. Firſt, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Talent of knowledge, in Miniſtring light in order to Converſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. Such ſhall ſhine as Stars for ever and ever, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that winneth Souls is wiſe, and the wiſe ſhall inherit Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Prov.</hi> 3.35. Thoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> converted <hi>are his Joy and Crown at Chriſts appearing,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to Charity, a Cup of cold Water, where no better is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad, ſhall have a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; any thing forſaken for Chriſt ſhall bring in a hundred fold. I have ſpoken to this before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As to ſufferings for Chriſt, thoſe that ſuffer with him ſhall reign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. therefore are they before the Throne, becauſe they came out of great tribulations. Theſe three ventures makes great returns if rightly managed, to a right end, with a good deſign.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But when is this return and increaſe? I anſwer, When the Voyage is made, when Chriſt the Maſter comes at the Reſurrection of the Juſt; thoſe that trade this way, muſt truſt till then; and all Chriſts Servants have good Inſurance on Gods ſide, the reward is very ſure; ſome are apt to look for their returns too ſoon, and to have loſt all; have a care of that, <hi>He that believeth makes not haſte.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a few words briefly, by way of Application to both parties. Are all Chriſts faithful Servants Traders, and is it a diſtinguiſhing Character between the faithful and ſlothful, that the good Servant traded, he went and traded?</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Uſe.</hi> Then theſe conſiderations ſhould put Chriſtians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination and inquity into their eſtate: Ask thy ſoul ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly this Queſtion, What trade doſt thou drive, and to what port doſt thou trade, to the Port of Heaven or Hell? the Apoſtle in other words ſpeaks the ſame thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Whatever a Man ſow, that ſhall he alſo reap: he that ſow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to the fleſh, and he that ſows to the Spirit, reaps accordingly:</hi> whither doſt thou trade, doſt thou trade for Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Then Firſt, Thou haſt thy heart concerned in the trade, and not only thy hands and body, it takes up thy heart: <hi>Where thy treaſure is,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>thy heart will be alſo:</hi> thoſe that trade
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33055:76"/>this way are men of judgment and underſtanding in what they do; it is the fruit of wildom to conſider our latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. and to provide for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doſt thou trade this way, thou doſt not think what thou ventureſt in this trade is loſt, becauſe it is out of ſight; but he goeth on comfortably, and believingly, though the greateſt part of his eſtate is beyond the grave. The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a worthy Merchant for Heaven, do but read his frame of Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 5. he ſpeaks like a man of grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>We walk by faith, and not by ſight;</hi> ſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> Theſe Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2 <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of exhortation, Be per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>waded each of you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your particular Talent that you are intruſted with. Firſt, Know it. Secondly, Stir it up. Labour to know what it is God hath principally intruſted thee with, either in quality or qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; ſome have one, ſome another, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gift; ſome have inward intruſtments, ſome outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt ments, and God expects the improvement of all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When thou knoweſt thy gift, ſtir it up; it was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Counſel to <hi>Timothy, To ſtir up the gift that was in him</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>As every one hath received the giſt, ſo let him Miniſter;</hi> whether in ſpirituals, or in temporal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; therefore labour to know that herein lyeth thy great wiſdom as a Chriſtian trader to vent and venture; do not keep thy goods in thy Ware-houſe, but ſend them abroad; caſt thy Bread upon the Waters: and to incourage thee, know that whatever thou ventureſt in this trade to this Port, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully inſured; and this St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew what he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this way was ſafe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12 <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.18. <hi>He that ſoweth to righteouſneſs, ſhall have a ſure reward.</hi> Secondly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> venturing and venting what you are intruſted with, do it upon the moſt acceptable terms; act as a wiſe Steward in each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtment.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Admire the great love and reſpect Chriſt bears to his Servants, in this one conſideration; that what Taient ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt intruſts his Servants with, is for their own good and profit, not his; he puts a ſtock into your hands to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, the ſtock and product ſhall be thy own, himſelf is not profited, but thou haſt the product of all thy ventures. So I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33055:76"/>have done with the ſecond Doctrine. We now proceed to the third Doctrine which was this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Doct.</hi> That all Chriſts gifts and intruſtments are for uſe, as well ſmall as great, two and one as well as five; Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects improvement of the leaſt Tale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> if but one; thoſe that have but little are not excuſed from ſervice. Thoſe under the Law that could not ſerve God with a Lamb, muſt bring two Turtle Doves or two young Pigeons; and if not ſo much, then a tenth part of an Ephah of Flower, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.7, 11. out of his little, he muſt ſacrifice a little, none muſt appear em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty; but as God had intruſted each of them with abilities, ſo they were to offer according to what he had received; the poor Widdow was accepted with her farthing, and it appears that it was not only accepted, but expected, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. from hence a Cup of cold Water given to a Diſciple is rewarded; but where much is given, there much is required; and that Servant that had ſo little knowledge as it is called, not knowing his Maſters will, yet he is beaten with few ſtripes for not improving that little, <hi>Luk</hi> 12.42. he expects improvement of little gifts and intruſtments.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of this Doctrine, This may ſerve to take off thoſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that many are apt to make, that they are very weak and poor, their gifts are ſmall, therefore they will do nothing; conſider that if thou haſt but one Talent, it is Chriſts Talent and gift as well as five.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be incouraged to improve, for by improvement thy little may be made more; for to him that hath (to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove) ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.26.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For incouragemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Conſider that thou with thy little, art as truly a Servant of Chriſt, as if thou hadſt a great deal; that Servant was Chriſts own Servant unto whom he gave one Talent, as much as he to whom he gave five; and he that improved two, is admitted into his Maſters joy as well as the other.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider for thy incouragement the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy Maſter, he requires but according to what he gives, if he gives more he requires more, if leſs he requires leſs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Have a ſpecial care of hiding or concealing thy intruſtments, that is a great evil, and upon what pretence ſoever done is greatly puniſhable, which leads me to the laſt Doctrine from theſe words which was this.</p>
                  <p>That amongſt Chriſts Servants there are ſome that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33055:77"/>obſcure, hide, or conceal thoſe Talents which they have received from Chriſt; this Chriſt foreſaw, that in his abſence near his coming he ſhould have ſome ſuch Servants. We have a bad Servant of Chriſt in this Chap, deſcribed under three ſimilitudes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A fooliſh Virgin. Secondly, Under the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> idle Servant. Thirdly, By a Goat; theſe are all un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ofitable to Chriſt. The Virgins afford him no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight, when he hath moſt need; the Goat affords him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o raiment, as the Sheep; the ſlothful Servant brings him in no increaſe in his ſtock or money; theſe Servants are all doomed alike to puniſhment, the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins ſhut out with, I know you not; the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant into utter darkneſs, the Goats into Hell fire. From whence we may gather, that there is an indiſpenſable duty upon all Chriſts Servants, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and faithful in improving what they have received from Chriſt, more or leſs; Oh! have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of a fearful frame of Spirit, the fearful are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as well as the abounuable; this frame of Spirit hath hindered many from improving their Talents, as I ſhall ſhew you afterward from Verſe 25. <hi>I was aſraid, and hid thy Yalent;</hi> our Lord had a taſte of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went from ſome we read of <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.42. the Text ſaith, <hi>Many believed on him but durſt not confeſs him, leſt thgy ſhould be cast out of the Synagogue; for they loved the praiſe of men, more than of God:</hi> and conſequently feared the frowns of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may Object, Is hiding and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we have received ſuch a ſin? Do we not read of ſome that hid Chriſts ſayings? and doth not <hi>David</hi> hide Gods word in his heart? and doth not <hi>Solc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> call to his Sons, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.23. to conceal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in their heart? To which I anſwer, We read of a twofold hiding in Scripture: Firſt, A hiding from a choice reſpect we have to a thing, in order to a ſafe keeping. Secondly, A hiding from uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This latter hiding is ſinful in ſpirituals; to hide what Talent Chriſt doth intruſt us with, is next door to the ſin of rejecting a Talent and refuſing to receive it.</p>
                  <p>Now in handling this Doctrine, I ſhall briefly ſpeak a few words to each of theſe four heads. Firſt, I ſhall open what this one Talent is that he hides. Secondly, When
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33055:77"/>a Perſon may be ſaid to hide his Talent. Thirdly, Shew ſome cauſes hereof. Fourthly, Speak a word of uſe to the whole. By this one Talent cannot be underſtood ſome one diſtinct gift or indowment, but rather a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſmaller meaſure, of what others are more largely intruſted with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By hiding, is not to expoſe it to publick view, it is oppoſed to trading with it, to hide is this, when a Perſon hath received from God gifts, but none can ſee it, nor perceive thou haſt it; to hide is oppoſed to ſtanding forth with light, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.1. ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7. Not to hide himſelf from his own fleſh, is to put forward to help. So to hide thy Talent, is when thou doſt not put it forth to ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a comparative hiding, when a Perſon can put forth his light in ſmaller and leſs dangerous opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and keep it in, in more large opportunities <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy profest a good profeſsion before many witneſſes.</hi> But ſome may object and ſay, Am not I forbid to caſt Pearl before Swine? I anſwer, We ought to be ſo wiſe as to know out times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to ſee when a door is opened to Gods Glory, and the good of others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a hiding our Talents by a corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; let a Man ſay what he will if he do not live to it, it gives no light; we read of ſome <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Who withhold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> or impriſon or conceal; to the end the <hi>Philippians might ſhine, they must be harmleſs or blameleſs, Phil.</hi> 2.16. walking honeſtly among the Gentiles, is a great duty, to the end our Talen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> might be improved. As to the third head I ſhall be very brief, becauſe I have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it before. I ſhall only in this place offer to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two occaſional grounds of this hiding thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ar. Secondly, An hard opinion of God; theſe two may be reduced into one, they depend one upon another, a hard opinion of God makes him afraid, a hard opinion of God doth ſweetly comply and comport with a ſlothful Perſon; is feeds this humour of ſloth; but I ſhall meet with this more properly in his place when we come at it only a few words by way of uſe from the whole. And Firſt,</p>
                  <p>Be exhorted from hence, not to hide or conceal what God hath intruſted thee with; ſtand forth as occaſion is offered, and thy help called for, whether in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, eſtate, ſufferings for Chriſt. It is reported of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn, Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>That they rejoyced that they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33055:78"/>were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for Christs name.</hi> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted this a worthy intruſtment. It is a dangerous evil to hide our Talent, and of a bad conſequence, from theſe ſix conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By hiding thy Talent God loſeth his Glory, which was one end of his intruſting thee, it is all one at if he had intruſted thee with none, if it be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore our Lord exhorts his Diſciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. that they ſhould <hi>Let ther lights ſo ſhine, that men ſeeing their good works, might glorifie their Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thou hideſt thy Talent, the Church loſeth her profit thereby; every gift is given for the good of the Body, the comfort and edification of the Body; therefore if thy Talent be hidden, the body hath loſs, if thou halt light it muſt be ſet upon a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,</hi> that it may give light to all that are in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> it muſt not be put under a Buſhel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If thou hideſt thy Talent, the World are great loſers, thou doſt not diſcharge that duty that is incumbent on thee, as to them. Ye are to be in Chriſts abſence, the light of the World, holding forth the word of truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Trading and improving thy Talents in a day when opportunity preſents, will be a great comfort to thee in an evil day, when thou haſt not that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; doubtleſs <hi>Solomons</hi> argument to inforce charity hath ſtrength in it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11 2. <hi>For thou knowest not whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Hiding our Talent, when called to put it forth, tends to our own eternal ruin; you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſufferings for Chriſt, I told you, is one of thoſe intruſtments we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:33055:78"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider that in all the Talents thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, thou art but a Steward for thy Maſter; and thou art not only to receive and lay up, but receive and lay out; if thou haſt more than another, it is put into thy hands for others as well as thy ſelf. So I have done with the fourth head.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="19" type="verse">
                  <p>We now proceed to the Fifth head contained Verſe Nineteenth propounded to be handled in our ſpeaking to this Parable, which was the return of the Maſter from his long Journey from Earth to Heaven. Now he returns from Heaven to Earth again, this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſpoken of in this Parable, this return of Chriſt was foretold by Chriſt before his going away.</p>
                  <p>We have in this nineteenth Verſe four circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The certainty of Chriſts return. It hath been already ſufficiently proved, that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſubject of our Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have clearly ſuppoſed in this Text, and taken for granted, the capacity that Chriſt in that his return ſhall come in; he cometh cloathed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power and dominion, he hath received the kingdom that he went to receive, according to <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.15. and to return having received it. It is plain that when Chriſt comes to reckon with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he is intruſted with the kingdom; if you ſhould ask me what kingdom? I anſwer, that kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. and 17. under the whole Heaven, which our laſt Prophet <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. foreſaw, the kingdoms of <hi>this World,</hi> ſhall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Chriſt; when all tongues, nations, and languages ſhall ſerve him. That Chriſt hath received this Kingdom when he comes is plain, from <hi>Math.</hi> 22. the King comes in to ſee the gueſts, the Lord of thoſe Servants cometh.</p>
                  <p>The Third circumſtance conſiderable in this Verſe, is conſiderable as to the period that Chriſt ſuppoſeth, expreſt here after a long time; a long time between his going away and coming: it is the opinion of moſt that it will be near 2000 years, therefore he is ſaid to go a far and long Journey.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth circumſtance conſiderable, is the work he propounds <hi>chiefly to do</hi> when he comes, and that is to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33055:79"/>reckon with them; <hi>After a long time the Lord of thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I lay down thoſe concluſions that do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe from theſe words, I ſhall explicate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſome words and paſſages in them. As Firſt, What kind of coming is this ſpoken of here. Secondly, What is this long time. Thirdly, Who are intended by thoſe Servants. Fourthly, What here is to be underſtood by reckoning.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This coming of Chriſt muſt be underſtood of his real perſonal coming, therefore it is ſaid 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend. As the kingdom that Chriſt receives is a real kingdom properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo is Chriſt a real proper and perſonal King: this kingdom was given him before his Aſcenſion, as we have it <hi>Math.</hi> 28. and <hi>laſt,</hi> All power in Heaven and Earth is given to me: But we muſt make a difference between a kingdom given, and a kingdom received; a Perſon may have a Legacy given him by Will, ſeveral years before he do actually poſſeſs it, and ſo it is here: It is a certain truth, that when Chriſt hath received this kingdom, he is ſubmitted unto by all Nations and People, they ſhall ſerve and obey him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt in this his return, muſt needs be in as real a ſtate as when he went away, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>As</hi> ye ſee me go, <hi>So I come again,</hi> in a Viſible appearance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. every Eye ſhall ſee him, not a ſpiritual inviſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or coming as ſome would have it in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but a real coming ſuch as ſhall amaze his enemies; thoſe that are his enemies ſhall call for the Rocks to hide <hi>them</hi> from the ſight of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>But what is this long time? I anſwer, Firſt, It may properly be called a long time in its ſelf, from his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to his ſecond Coming, as I ſaid before near 2000 years. Secondly. A long time as conſidered to Man, conſidered many generations paſſe in this time. Thirdly, A long time as with reſpect to his faithful Servants longing deſires; they think it long, they think the Bridegroom tarrys: but how ſhall we reconcile this long time with a little while, commonly ſet out by <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Yet a little while and he ſhall come,</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.17. <hi>A little while and I will ſee you again</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſw,</hi> Sometimes a little and a long time is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33055:79"/>as to God-ward; a little time with God, is a long time with Man; this St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to argue, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack as ſome men countſlackneſs.</hi> Men count it a long time; but a 1000 years with God, is but as one day; ſo here according as men count, it is a long time, but all things with God are preſent. Secondly, It is a long time comparatively underſtood, long in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the time; after ſuch and ſuch things ſhall appear, then it is but a little time. After this manner Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. When the Churches ſorrows are at the higheſt and ſharpeſt, then it is but a little before Chriſt comes, ſee <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. when ſuch thangs appear; then yet a little time, and he that ſhall <hi>come will come:</hi> ſo muſt it be underſtood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Then it is near, even at the door.</hi> The third thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, who are thoſe Servants intended, called here thoſe Servants? I anſwer, By thoſe are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Servants indefinitely conſidered, for this is a relation to Verſe fourteenth, called there his own Servants indefinitely conſidered, ſuch as he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with his ſubſtance, thoſe Servants. Fourthly, What is this reckoning with them? this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is drawn from a word that ſignifies to ſpeak or reaſon; and ſome render it ſpeaking with them, ſome to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with them: And indeed Chriſts reckoning with them, is only a fair reaſoning with them, as we ſee by the following Verſes; for our Lord admits of a reply, the Servant ſpeaks in his own defence as long as he hath a word to ſpeak, and then out of his own mouth Chriſt condemns him, for every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and all the World ſhall become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as we may ſee in the Parable of the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.18. ſee there how Chriſt reaſons with them, <hi>Friend I do thee no wreng, didſt not thou agree with me for a penny?</hi> So here did I not find thee ſlack, thou wert only required to put it forth; thou didſt herein but venture mine, not thy own: thus Chriſt reckoneth with them or reaſoneth rather. Before I proceed I ſhall ſum up the matter of this Text into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Doct.</hi> One of the great and firſt buſineſſes propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to be entred upon at and in his next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to reckon, reaſon, and deal with his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Though he will judge the World, yet he doth begin at his own Houſe firſt: As the Servants of Chriſt are raiſed firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 ſo they ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, this is a certain truth. But for brevity ſake I ſhall in the handling of the firſt Doctrine, endeavour to draw in theſe two latter Doctrines if I can.</p>
                  <p>This great truth of Chriſts ſecond coming, hath been richly placed upon the hearts of Gods people from the beginning of the World. This return of Chriſt was ſeen of <hi>Enoch</hi> who lived in the beginning of the World, he propheſied of his ſecond coming. See the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Iude, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints.</hi> This the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth of <hi>Zac.</hi> 14.5. <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, ſee 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. c. 4. c. 5. And it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that more than twenty times our Lord hints and foretells his ſecond coming again before he went away.</p>
                  <p>As we may find in <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke, Iohn,</hi> it was frequent with Chriſt before he went to foretell his coming. And that from theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe this was a rich truth, therefore it dwelt richly upon Chriſts heart, he did not go away as not to come again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he knew well, for his exaltation, that where he ſuffered he ſhould come again and be glorified, out Lord was willing to leave this truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record, as from himſelf as well as from his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth our Lord is very careful to aſſert and ſtrengthen, as well knowing that this would be a truth much queſtioned and doubted by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and oppoſed and mocked at by enemies. The Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt intend little leſs. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.45. when they ſay their Lord delays his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereupon fall to beating their fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and eating and drinking with the drunken, and what doth it import leſs, when it is ſo often ſaid that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33055:80"/>Chriſt ſhall come in a day when they are not aware, nor look not for him? and the World in general are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of faith in this ſecond coming of Chriſt; this St. <hi>Peter</hi> foreſaw, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. they mock and ſcoff at ſuch a principle, therefore our Lord doth often hint and aſſert his ſecond coming, that he might ſtrengthen that part that was weak.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. This our Lord is frequent in to aſſert his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming before his going away, to ſtrengthen and incourage their hearts as to a truth that would much contribute to their joy, for what could more contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their comfort and joy, than the thoughts and belief of Chriſts coming? This is their encouragement in all their tribulations, and to that end it is applied by Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. <hi>I will come and ſee you again.</hi> To the ſame end doth the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> apply it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. <hi>Be patient Brethren, the coming of the Lord draws nigh.</hi> Chriſt well knew that it would be the joy and life of his Diſciples to hear of his coming again, who were ſo ſorrowful at his going away. And there are four chioce priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Chriſts ſecond coming, that make it very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, At this his coming, there is an end put to all temptations Satan can tempt no more nor can they ſin any more, the righteouſneſs of Saints, that is now liable to blemiſhes, and corruptions, but ſhall then be pure and permanent, <hi>then he that is righteous ſhall be righteous ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, At the Maſters coming, the Servants are diſcharged from all their work, and from all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtments, their commiſſion then expires, it is but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy till I come, then they are to enter into their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters joy, no longer Servants but rulers over Cities, <hi>what thou haſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hold faſt till I come, Rev.</hi> 2.27. then will I diſcharge thee, nay ſaith our Lord if thou ſerveſt me faithfully till then, I will gird my ſelf and ſerve thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, At Chriſts coming thou ſhalt not only be taken off from all thy work, but largely rewarded for thy work done, now as the hireling longeth for the evening, becauſe he might receive his wages. <hi>Iob</hi> 7.2. ſo a Servant of Chriſt hath reaſon and allowance to look for his reward, and long for it alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He ſhall not only then receive his wages
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33055:81"/>and reward for his work, but great praiſe alſo for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> work; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Thon ſhall every man have praiſe of God:</hi> ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt. Whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 17. found unto praiſe then; and it is no ſmall priviledge to have praiſe of God, for Chriſt to praiſe a poor ſoul at that day is a great priviledge, this was the caſe with the faithful Servant, Well done good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. For a King in ſuch ſtate and glory, to praiſe and commend a poor creature, how raviſhing a priviledge is it! <hi>Queſt.</hi> A faithful Servant of Chriſt for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deſires his ſecond coming, but why is it ſaid after a long time the Lord of theſe Servants cometh? <hi>I Anſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Lord foreſaw that ſome would be apt to look for him too ſoon: there are two extreams that perſons are apt to be attended with, in the latter days, as to Chriſts ſecond coming, as we may perceive by the Apoſtles application to each of them in Scriptures: there are ſome that are apt to look for him too ſoon, to ſuch the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> addreſſeth himſelf, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. with much ardency and affection to divert their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, ſeeing it to be a dangerous opinion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may perceive there are ſome alſo who are apt to put this day far away from them: to theſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> applieth himſelf, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. becauſe all things continue as they were from the beginning, therefore they conclude it would not come at all; to ſuch he aſſerts his coming: but the day of the Lord will come not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſeeming long tarrying.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the 2 <hi>Doct.</hi> I ſhall take it in proſecution of this Doctrine, and from thence ſpeak unto the nature of Chriſts ſecond coming, which (according to the ſecond Doctrine) is as cloathed with dominion. The Lord of thoſe Servants he comes cloathed with ſuch power that when he is but demanding a queſtion of him that had not on the wedding garment, he is ſtruck ſpeechleſs, ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 22.11 <hi>When the King came in to ſee the gueſts.</hi> And the very ſight of Chriſt in his coming, cauſeth the greateſt men on earth to call to the Rocks and Mountains to fall on them, and hide them from his face, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>The uſe that we may make of theſe three Doctrines put together is, firſt by way of examination.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How doth thy heart breath after thy Maſters
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33055:81"/>coming, doſt thou fear it, or doſt thou deſire it, how is it with thee, if thou art a wicked Servant, thou maiſt juſtly fear thy Maſters coming from a five fold Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He comes to thee as a perſon who haſt abuſed his tender mercy, and favours, which will greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate thy ſorrows, and fears, and juſtly provoke God againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That great power that Chriſt in this his coming is cloathed with, is all againſt thee, to cruſh thee, and deſtroy thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt to ſuch is clothed with as much wrath as power, and all his power is ſubſervient to his wrath, which ſhall make all ſinners (though in <hi>Zion</hi>) afraid with great fear, ſee <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, and fearfulneſs ſhall ſurprize the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</hi> Then in that day he that hath been for a long time a Lamb, meek, gentle, and patient, ſhall then be a Lyon, which ſhall tear and rend, and none ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This day is ſad, becauſe they ſhall loſe all that they have wrought, though thou haſt prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied or Preacht, caſt out Devils, done many mighty works, all is in vain.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Then no more opportunity or intruſtment, no Tryal more! then the Summer is paſt, the Harveſt is ended, and ſuch are not ſaved, it is a ſad word, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By way of Tryal, art thou a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thou believeſt Chriſts coming, thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Principle that he ſhall come, this was the Faith of all Chriſts faithful Servants, they could ſay, <hi>he that ſhall come, will come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thou beeſt a faithful Servant, thou are preparing for his coming, ſo as to endeavour to have all the work done againſt he come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou prayeſt for his coming, it is one petition in thy prayer with St. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If thou beeſt one of Chriſts Diſciples, thou rejoyceſt in the faith and thoughts of Chriſts coming. As it was proper for Chriſts Servants to ſorrow at

                  <p>The Third thing to be inquired into, (and which takes in the third Doctrine) is what Chriſt at this his coming ſhall enter upon firſt, the anſwer lyeth in the text, to Judge his own houſe, called here reaſoning, or reckoning with them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts own Servants muſt be judged firſt, the firſt piece of juſtice diſpenced by Chriſt, is to his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they muſt be judged, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.10. for we muſt all appear <hi>before the Iudgment ſeat of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) he comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, and that he may firſt judge them, he firſt raiſeth then out of their graves, as we have it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. they that are Chriſts (that is to ſay his own) ſhall be raiſed at his coming, which is plain 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Thoſe that ſleep in Ieſus will God bring with him,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. And there is much and good reaſon why Chriſt ſhall judge his houſe firſt, and ſet that in order, and acquit the guiltleſs and faithful.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Saints muſt joyn with him in judging World according to the 1 <hi>Corinth,</hi> 6.2. <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the World.</hi> Therefore they cannot be tryed at the ſame Bar, but muſt be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and then they enter into their Maſters joy, Glory, and Dominion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> By way of Uſe, Firſt, from hence we may learn this plain and wholeſome truth, that even Chriſts Diſciples muſt be tryed and judged. Some have been ready to think that Saints ſhould not be judged any otherwiſe than what they meet with in themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith if they would judge themſelves, <hi>they ſhould not be judged of the</hi>

Therefore in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, ſeeing his coming is to take account of his own Servants; indeavour to calculate all thy actions and doings for this day.

                  <p>We now proceed to the matter and manner of Chriſt's reaſoning or reckoning. We had before from <hi>ver.</hi> 19. That Chriſt comes to reckon with his ſervants; we have here the matter of fact, the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf. And this reckoning I ſhall divide into two parts. Firſt, a reckoning with the induſtrious; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the ſlothful Servants.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the Induſtrious and Faithful in Chriſt's houſe firſt, becauſe that lyeth firſt here in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and becauſe the reckoning is ſo interwoven and mixed with the reward, I ſhall at once glance at theſe four <hi>verſes,</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In handling this latter part of the Parable I ſhall be very brief, becauſe I have anticipated much of the matter before in what I have ſpoken as to this parable.</p>
                  <p>We have contained in this reckoning theſe two Subjects, Reckoning and Recompence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It muſt be ſuppoſed that this Reckoning or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is called for by Chriſt, not that they came vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and offered themſelves to tryal, becauſe it is here ſaid, <hi>he came:</hi> For according to <hi>Luke</hi> 19.15. the parallel place ſaith, <hi>he commanded them to be called,</hi> or brought, who had been intruſted with his Coin or Subſtance. However the Servants are willing to come to account, and the beſt firſt. Our Lord in this his Reckoning begins with two Queſtons, as muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: Firſt, <hi>what haſt thou received?</hi> Secondly <hi>what haſt thou gained?</hi> To both which Chriſt's ſervants are ready to return an anſwer.</p>
                  <p>In our glance upon this Reckoning, we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable firſt, as to Chriſt's ſervants; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſomething remarkable as from the Lord. We have two things conſiderable as to the ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have the willingneſs and freeneſs to make an acknowledgment of what they are charged with. We find Chriſt chargeth one with five, one with two, and another with one; and herein there is no difference, their Accounts, though of ſo long ſtanding, agree; no difference in their Account, here is right reckoning on both hands.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:33055:83"/>
                  <p>Secondly, as conſiderable in Chriſt's Servants, they are ready to produce their Effects more or leſs, as to acknowledg the Stock, and to expoſe it to their Maſter and to his uſe, it is ready for him; <hi>behold, I have gained beſides them five Talents more;</hi> I have doubled. I pray take notice <hi>(behold)</hi> he hath a deſire to have his Account paſt, he is forward therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; we have ſomething worthy obſervation in their Lord. Firſt, we have their Lord's good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and choice acceptance of their Account and Returns, their good ſervice wins much upon their Lord's heart. But ſecondly, it appears in his aſſigned Reward hereupon; which conſiſts in two parts. Firſt, Rule. Secondly, Joy. The nature of which Joy we have explained and called their <hi>Maſter's Joy.</hi> The next thing I ſhall do in proſecution of this Subject, is, to explain ſome words and phraſes in theſe words; as firſt, When may a ſervant be ſaid to double his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Secondly, When may a ſervant of Chriſt be by Chriſt called good. Thirdly, What are thoſe few things ſpoken of in which he had been faithful? Fourthly, What is this Rule that ſhall be an eminent part of the ſervants reward? Fifthly, What kind of Joy may this be underſtood to be, called the <hi>Maſter's Joy.</hi> A word to each of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When doth he double, or make ſuch a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory increaſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy Gain doth lye in three heads. Firſt, Gain in Grace. Secondly, Gain ſouls to Chriſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gain in glory to God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. Thou art an acceptable Servant, or Gainer, when thou haſt gained increaſe in the Gifts and Graces that God hath beſtowed on thee. It is a Chriſtian's duty to multiply and add to what he hath received of this kind. To grow in grace is a poſitive
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33055:84"/>duty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. And that this is wonderfully acceptable to God where there is an addition, we may perceive, if we ſeriouſly read 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. to the tenth verſe, this is called Fruit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Not that I deſire a Gift</hi> (ſaith-<hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>but I deſire fruit that may abound to your account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then are you gainers with acceptance, when your Talent by improving hath gained ſouls to Chriſt, more Servants into the Maſter's family. This is Chriſt's glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>Here am I, and my Children:</hi> how many Servants haſt thou Gained and begotten to Chriſt? This ſhall be thy Glory and Crown in the day of Chriſt; this is <hi>Paul's</hi> glory, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. laſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; That which is thy acceptable Gain, is, when thou haſt walked ſo, as to gain glory to God and Chriſt by thy walkings: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>That they may glorifie thy Father which is in heaven.</hi> It was that which Jeſus Chriſt pleaded to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth;</hi> and theſe will God glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in heaven. This is to walk worthy of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. and worthy of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How may a Servant of Chriſt deſerve the name good? None is good but God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> None is good in the abſtract but God; good ſo as to have no mixtures of evil: but ſome are called good, as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts 11.24. is ſaid to be a good man: but good in the fence of the text muſt be taken for one profitable and beneficial; ſo we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a good Servant to us is a profitable Servant, one that is faithful in our buſineſs to our profit; the good Servant here is as much as if he had ſaid, profitable Servant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What are theſe few things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>few things</hi> we muſt refer to the Talents as before; the few things are the five Talents; the Maſter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33055:84"/>his intruſtments to magnifie the profit of the Servant. Chriſt ſpeaks with the leaſt, byway of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution from what he had intruſted him with; I truſted thee with but a few things; Chriſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all diſadvantages in quality and quantity, that he might advance the Faithfulneſs of his Servants to him, <hi>Thou haſt been faithful in a few things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>What Rule ſhall this be as part of the Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> The ſame that Chriſt's ſhall be; as the Joy, ſo the Rule. It is material Command, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. Rule over the nations with Chriſt, as here over ten Cities.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When-as here it is called the <hi>Maſters Joy,</hi> it implys a very large and unſpeakable Joy: Joy in this fence is not only Goodneſs but Glory. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>anointed with the oile of Gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45. but his fellows ſhall have ſome of the ſame anointings; though not ſo much in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, yet the ſame in quality and kind, it is the Joy of the Lord. There are ten Parts obſervable in theſe words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the beſt and higheſt intruſted Servants of Chriſt muſt be accountable for their ſtock received: ſuch as have received five Talents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A True and Faithful Servant of Chriſt is very free and apt to acknowledg all his Enjoyments and Intruſtments to be of God; <hi>Thou deliveredſt unto me five Talents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where Chriſt hath given Stock, he doth indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly require Improvements.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Winning and gaining, is the required and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Jeſus Chriſt is exceedingly pleaſed, even to

                  <p n="6">6. Faithfulneſs and induſtry, ſloathfulneſs and wickedneſs are taken on for another by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Chriſt's way of trying his Servants is by truſting them with a little firſt, called here <hi>few things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The well improvement of a little in Spirituals, doth infallibly introduce and bring in increaſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Future Rule is one great part of Chriſt's future Reward to his Faithful Servants for their induſtry.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the ſtate and Condition of Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at his Coming, is a ſtate of great Joy. Of theſe a few words.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall paſs theſe Obſervations very briefly, becauſe I have ſpoken ſomething in the opening of the words to ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; <hi>That the beſt and higheſt of Chriſt's Servants muſt be accountable to Chriſt at his Coming.</hi> This is often hinted in the Scriptures; thoſe two Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Paul</hi> takes in himſelf, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt: to receive the things done in the body, whether they be good, or bad:</hi> the good muſt be brought there as well as the bad. This Truth (is at leaſt) implicitely held forth, in the meſſage of Chriſt to <hi>Pergamos.</hi> Thoſe that are praiſe-worthy muſt receive a white-ſtone, a token of their Acquitting and Juſtification, which is ſpoken in a borrowed ſpeech, from the manner of the proceedings of the Courts of Judicature in thoſe days; when perſons were acquitted they had a white-ſtone given into their hands. Which doth teach us that the innocent as well as the guilty, the faithful as well as the wicked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, muſt be reckoned with; this is the day of blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the ſins of true converted perſons. See <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. this is the proper time when thoſe praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33055:86"/>ſhall receive praiſe of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. The Conſideration of this truth ſerves to teach humility and holineſs; thy actions muſt be examined by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt before thou art commended; whatſoever men ſay of thee or account of thee, that is the day of manifeſtation of thy Faithfulneſs. This well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, will much promote Holineſs and Carefulneſs. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Wherefore we labour that we may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him.</hi> So much for the Firſt Part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Part. <hi>The true and Faithful Servants of God are free and ready to acknowledg all their enjoyments and intruſtments are of God.</hi> This I might largely prove from the Current of Scriptures; but I forbear to be large; only ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> And as they are ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg whilſt they are here, ſo they are as ready to acknowledg it to Chriſt at his appearance, as in our Text. And all this ariſeth from that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of humility dwelling in them, which makes them little in their own eyes both now and then. Read the frame of Spirit that dwelt upon Holy and Humble <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. I ſhall only leave this one word of inſtruction from hence; Study how acceptable this frame of Spirit is to Chriſt when he findeth it, either now or then.</p>
                  <p>Part. 3. <hi>When Stock is given, there is improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indiſpenſibly required; the Contrary will not be born by God or Chriſt.</hi> This I have ſpoken unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Part. 4. <hi>That the right ſtate of Chriſt is a Winning Gaining ſtate.</hi> If thy State be right, as it ought to be, thou art gaining, increaſing, and adding in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. This is a true and a proper Character of a righteous and holy perſon, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>he grows ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> The Father, who is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33055:87"/>purgeth his vine, <hi>John.</hi> 15. that it may bring forth more Fruit. This I have toucht upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Part. 5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is pleaſed even to delight in an induſtrious improving Soul.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is herein like a frugal man in the world, he loves to ſee his tenants and Servants thrive under him. The Spirit of <hi>Paul</hi> was the ſame that dwelt in Chriſt, when he was glad and rejoiced in the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> increaſe in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, 2 Theſſ. 1.3. <hi>That their faith groweth, and their charity aboundeth.</hi> This is that which the Spirit of God takes notice of in the Church of <hi>Thiatira,</hi> Rev. 2, <hi>Thy laſt works are more than thy firſt.</hi> And from whence doth this ariſe in God and Chriſt? not becauſe our profiting is to his own profit, no, we can add nothing to his glory: but the love of God to his creature is ſuch, that he would have us bring forth fruit that might abound to our own account: admire the goodneſs and dear love of Chriſt to his Servants.</p>
                  <p>Part. 6. <hi>Faithfulneſs and induſtry are in Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſame thing, and ſloathfulneſs and wickedneſs are the ſame.</hi> He that improves his Talents, doth bear the appellation of <hi>Good and Faithful Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are now upon the induſtrious Servant, he had traded to advantage, and he is Faithful. Faithfulneſs is a proper qualification in a Servant; <hi>that he be found faithful</hi> is required in a Steward, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. that is, that he makes a diſtribution to each according to their ſeveral needs. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. He is a Faithful Steward that gives them meat in due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Uſe. A ſloathful Servant of Chriſt can never be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned faithful. Sloathfulneſs is no ſuch ſmall ſin as ſome take it to be; there is a curſe pronounced by God againſt a ſloathful perſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. <hi>that doth the work or buſineſs of the Lord negligently.</hi> A faithful Servant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33055:87"/>hath theſe three properties: Firſt. He is diligent in his buſineſs in which he is intruſted. Secondly, he aims and deſignes his Maſters profit in all he does. Thirdly he ſtands up for his Maſters Name and Credit in what he does. A good and <hi>faithful Servant</hi> anſwers to all theſe.</p>
                  <p>Part. 7. <hi>Chriſt's uſual way is to try his Servants with a little firſt.</hi> All that he intruſts his Servants in this world, though never ſo large intruſtments, are but ſmall and few things in compariſon of what they ſhall be truſted with hereafter: there are true riches to commit to his faithful Servants, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10, 11, 12. The intruſtments here are called the leaſt things, and he that is unfaithful in theſe leaſt, ſhall not be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with much. O then Conſider, that thy future intruſtment depends upon thy preſent improvement of what thou haſt committed to thee, whether it be Wiſdom, Riches, or any other Gift; thou haſt thoſe Gifts only for a tryal, and thou art now only in the Tryal; thou muſt be tryed before thou be truſted more.</p>
                  <p>Part. 8. Is the Uſe of this; <hi>Be aſſured that the well-improvement of a little ſhall certainly bring in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: To him that hath, ſhall be given &amp; he ſhall have abundance,</hi> as we have it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. we have a double <hi>ſhall</hi> to confirm the truth of this.</p>
                  <p>Part. 9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt rewards his faithful Servants with Rule and Government. Be thou over ten Cities.</hi> And that this is properly and really to be taken is plentifully proved from other Scriptures: Dan. 7.27. <hi>The Kingdom under the whole Heavens ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high.</hi> And in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Scriptures; But I ſhall meet with this more fully afterwards.</p>
                  <p>This reward is a very great reward in Chriſt's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33055:88"/>ſufficient to requite his Servants for all their ſaithfulneſs and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>Part. 10. <hi>The ſtate will be a ſtate of very great Joy,</hi> called here <hi>the Maſter's Joy;</hi> a ſtate of unſpeakable joy. Sometimes this ſtate of Joy comprehends all good, as ſorrow comprehends all evil. See an eminent place to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. <hi>And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Zion with ſongs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain in and gladneſs; and ſorrow and ſighings ſhall flee away.</hi> This I have according to my promiſe, only touched theſe ten Parts, and ſo I have done with the 20, 21, 22, 23. verſes.</p>

                  <p>That which remains to be handled as to the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this ſecond Parable, is that remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage relating to the ſloathful and unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which was him who had received the one Talent; a relation of whom we have contained in theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> verſes: the whole whereof divides it ſelf into three Parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Servant's Anſwer, Plea and Defence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord's ill-reſentment and diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction thereat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his proceeding thereupon.</p>
                  <p>Now for order's Sake, I ſhall ſpeak to theſe heads diſtinctly; and</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Servant's Anſwer, Plea and Defence. An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I call it, becauſe it muſt be implyed that his Lord in his reckoning with him propounds a double Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Firſt. <hi>What haſt thou received?</hi> Secondly; <hi>What improvement haſt thou made?</hi> This firſt Part contains <hi>verſe.</hi> 24.25. in which verſes we have his Confeſſion and Conciſion with his Lord that he had received one Talent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have him, as formerly, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had made no improvement; and he ſeems to ſix the foot and foundation of his non-improvement upon his Lord, namely his Lord's auſterity and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the fence and knowledg whereof begat fear in him, which fear diſinabled him, bound up his hands, took away his heart, hindred his induſtry; and in ſhort, all the whole fault of his miſcarrying in this affair is wholly laid upon his Lord, even as our father <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. And all this evil, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33055:89"/>upon a miſtake of the nature and Juſtice of his Lord: as firſt he chargeth his Lord with hardneſs or auſterity, according to the paralel place, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.20. <hi>For I feared thee becauſe thou wert an auſtere Man:</hi> Secondly, he chargeth his Lord with unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exaction; like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who required bricks, and gave no ſtraw: So ver. 21. <hi>Thou takeſt up that thou layeſt not down, and reapeſt that thou didſt not Sow, or gatheredſt where thou haſt not ſtrawed;</hi> and this charge he doth not exhibit as by report or hear-ſay, but upon ſure and certain knowledg, <hi>I knew thee that thou wert a hard man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We find him not only charging his Lord, but Juſtifying himſelf, and that by a threefold Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Firſt, I do not ſlight or caſt away thy Talent, but I had an eſteem for thy Talent, and I laid it up accordingly, I wrapt it up ſafe in a napkin. Secondly, I had a care o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, that it ſhould not be loſt or ſtoln, I digged a hole in the earth and laid it up ſafe, I did not caſt it careleſly away. And Thirdly, This I did not for my own profit or advantage, but for thine, that I might keep it and render it whole to thee as the owner: See the words <hi>loe,</hi> or <hi>behold</hi> there is thine own; <hi>(acce)</hi> behold, or take notice; he makes proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As if he ſhould ſay, I care not who ſees my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they are ſo righteous; I give thee that which is thine own, what canſt thou deſire more? I have not loſt or imbezelled it away, there it is.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to the Obſervations, I ſhall ſpeak a few words by way of explication of ſome words and paſſages in the Text; as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how comes this Servant to aſſume this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and freedom of Speech?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How comes this Servant to underſtand
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33055:89"/>this auſterity and ſeverity, or what doth he intend by it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſpeak a few words as to the falſity and untruth of this charge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What is this fear that ſurprized this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What is to be underſtood by his hiding his Talent in the earth?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, How came he by this knowledg that he can ſay here, he knew? A few words to each of theſe, and that briefly, and ſo I ſhall proceed to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                  <p>How comes it to paſs that this Wicked and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant doth aſſume ſuch boldneſs and Confidence in the preſence of his Lord, cloathed with ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and majeſty? doth it not ſeem to croſs many other Scriptures, which ſpeak of fear and ſhame to be upon ſuch, Iſa. 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in</hi> Zion <hi>ſhall be afraid, fearfulneſs ſhall ſurprize</hi> the hypocrite. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. who at one queſtion demanded by Chriſt is ſtruck ſpeechleſs. And doth not <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 3. tell us, with reſpect to this day, that every mouth ſhall be ſtopt? here ſeems to be the contrary; this Hypocrite is bold, and his mouth open. Yet notwithſtanding theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, other Scriptures are plain, that bad perſons and hypocrites ſhall plead with Chriſt in that day; and not only plead, but plead hard and ſtifly, ſo that Chriſt cakes ſome pains to ſhake them off; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. Therefore to reconcile theſe Scriptures, I underſtand there are 2 ſorts of Hypocrites: one ſort who are groſs Hypocrites, that are ſo by a deſign; a prophane perſon in Saints apparel, that knows he is ſo, only he is deſigned to be thought otherwiſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is another ſort of Hypocrites who (as <hi>Caryl</hi> on <hi>Job.</hi> 34.30. calls them) are ſimple or ſincere hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33055:90"/>who do not deſign to deceive, but are deceived themſelves and think their ſtate good. And ſuch a ſort muſt be underſtood in this Chapter, and alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. who did not diſtruſt their own ſtate, but thought their ſtate to be good enough. Of ſuch a ſort of perſons <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3. <hi>If any man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing,</hi> he ſuppoſeh ſuch there are who in their own thoughts be right: There are ſelf-deceivers, which <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of Chap. 1.22. and they are ſuch who truſt to their being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word only. Now ſuch as theſe thinking well of themſelves, no wonder if they be bold: there are ſome perſons that in the day of Chriſt ſhall ſuffer great diſappointment, contrary to their expectations: ſo that not all Hypocrites ſhall be afraid, though the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality ſhall. And thoſe we read of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.42, 43, &amp;c. that were ſpeechleſs at Chriſt's asking a queſtion, doth not take off, but that ſome may anſwer as in our Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> At laſt thoſe Scriptures alſo will be fulfilled, there will be cauſe of Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation alſo, when they are caſt at the bar of Chriſt, and then all ſuch ſhall be ſpeechleſs, and every mouth ſtopped: and this will be the ſtate of this Servant in our Text, when he ſeeth his pleas prove ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>But from what here hath been ſpoken, may ſome demand, <hi>Is it poſſible for a perſon to be a hypocrite, and himſelf not know it? how ſhall I then know what my ſtate is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> It is true, that you may be deceived in your ſelves, muſt be taken for granted, from the many Cautions and Counſels given againſt ſelf-deceit; and Counſel to <hi>examine our ſelves, our own ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. But, to know thy ſtate to be good and free
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33055:90"/>from hypocriſie, inquire after theſe qualifications, which are infallible marks of Sincerity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doſt thou make Conſcience of the moſt ſecret Sins and Evils to avoid them, even vain thoughts?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doſt thou make Conſcience of the moſt Secret Duties to do them, Secret Prayer, Secret Alms, and ſuch-like? I only leave this brief touch here, becauſe it is handled before.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, What doth this Servant intend by his Lords being <hi>auſtere</hi> or hard, according to <hi>Luke</hi> 19. and no-where elſe uſed in the Scriptures through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It ſignifyeth a ſevere, cruel, ſowre, as we call it, cruel, miſerable man; in oppoſition to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, mildneſs, gentleneſs, freeneſs, mercifulneſs, Juſtice and equity.</p>
                  <p>But is this charge true or falſe?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is utterly falſe, from a four-fold te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. 1. The Teſtimony of God himſelf. 2ly. From the Teſtimony and Experience of the People of God in all ages. 3dly. From the works and ways of God and Chriſt in all ages the contrary appeareth. 4thly. This very Servant implicitly ſets forth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. This Charge is falſe from the Lord's own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, who cannot lye, nor needs not Care for any man. See the publication of his Name, which agrees with his Nature; Mercifulneſs, and Graciouſneſs and Goodneſs is a great part of his Name and Nature, and Jeſus Chriſt in whom the God-head dwelt bodily was not the Contrary, harſh and cruel. The tenderneſs of God exceeds the tenderneſs of a Mother to her ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. from 11 to 33. what a quite contrary nature is in Chriſt? <hi>I forgave thee all thy debt aſſoon as deſired.</hi>

                        </gap> was grieved for their miſery:</hi> See the nature of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3, to 14. ſee Gods condeſcenſion <hi>to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> pleading for <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 28. if God had been cruel and harſh, he had not given Chriſt. Secondly, if Chriſt had been cruel and harſh, he had not freely offered himſelf, and admirable is this ſweet nature in Chriſt! Oh the frequent manifeſt ſympathy with poor Creatures in diſtreſs, he had compaſſion on them, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, ſhewed mercy to them. We read of Chriſt but twice weeping in his time on earth, and both times ariſing from the ſweetneſs and goodneſs of his nature; once he wept over <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11. once over <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Luke</hi> 19. Let Chriſt's works ſpeak for him, that the ſuggeſtion of the Sloathful Servant is utterly untrue, when he ſaith, <hi>I knew thee that thou wert a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> auſtere man;</hi> a hard and a cruel man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This imputation put upon Chriſt, is falſe from the ſervants own mouth: as Firſt, he cannot
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33055:91"/>but confeſs that his Lord had truſted him with a part of his eſtate; he therefore falſly chargeth his Lord <hi>with reaping where he had not ſown:</hi> for he confeſſeth, that he had received one Talent, which was ſeed ſown. Thus I have briefly endeavoured to diſcharge our good Lord from this falſe imputation.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth thing I am to ſpeak to is the nature of this fear that ſurpriſed this ſloathful ſervant, <hi>What kind of fear is this? [I was afraid]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> There are two ſorts of Fear with reſpect to God.</p>

                     </gap>s us in awe that we ſin not; this Fear is a good and a profitable Fear.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a legal ſlaviſh Fear, the tendency whereof is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> drive men to deſpair of God and his goodneſs. This Fear was of this Second ſort which begot in him a diſreſpect to his Lord, as appears; and this Fear led him to great negligence in duty.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly. What may we underſtand, or rather what would he have his Lord underſtand by his hiding his Talent; or, as ſome read, <hi>concealing;</hi> for he ſeems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Circumſtances conſidered, this hiding muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in direct oppoſition to the former trading requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt, and acted by ſome of the Servants; which Chriſt declareth his well-liking of before they had vented and ventured their Talents, as you have heard; like <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 40. who would not conceal but declare his righteouſneſs; but this Servant hides or conceals his Talent: and this hiding is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the worſt of hidings; it ſeems to be a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hiding. Some concealings we are (as we may ſay) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to by <hi>perſecution</hi> and <hi>oppoſition;</hi> but this man
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33055:92"/>went and digged (took pains) to hide his Talent his Lords money.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly; What may we underſtand this Knowledg to be <hi>[I know thee.]</hi> The word here ſignifies a certain Knowledg, not a Conjectural Knowledg; although this Knowledg in it ſelf is a falſe perſwaſion, yet to him it ſeemed certain, it was rooted and ſealed in his heart, and ſo grew up to a full perſwaſion; I did firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without doubt believe.</p>
                  <p>But having briefly opened theſe words, I ſhall ſum up what is teaching to us from them into two parts of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 1. That very wicked perſons, ſuch as Chriſt is altogether unacquainted with, and ſhall eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at his Coming, yet theſe perſons ſhall aſſume knowledg of, and great confidence in him: ſuch ſhall ſeem at firſt to have that choice privilidg proper to his moſt faithful Servants abiding in him, 1 Joh. 2.28. <hi>Who ſhall have boldneſs and confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his Coming.</hi> This is plain, Mat. 7. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 2. It is a very dangerous and deſtructive thing for perſons to entertain a falſe and hard opinion of the Lord, that he is <hi>Auſtere and Cruel;</hi> now many have been deſtroyed temporally and eternally from this ground, diſtruſting that God would not have mercy on them? but give me leave to tell thee, who-ever thou art, that thou haſt to do with a very tender and merciful God, that is willing to ſave to the utmoſt ſuch as comes to him. My warrant to bear me out ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 3. It is the nature of ſlothful negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as to their own Spiritual Concerns, to quarrel with God and Chriſt, and impute their miſcarriages unto them.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:33055:92"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 4. That the dear Son of God, who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs it ſelf in the very abſtract; yet he hath been alwaies liable to the moſt falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable imputations: what a plentiful meaſure of this did Chriſt meet with when he was one earth? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his life, and ſince his aſcenſion the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 5. That Jeſus Chriſt never meets with more baſe and unworthy dealing from any, than from thoſe who have received moſt kindneſs from him. This was propheſied of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. and fulfilled in <hi>Judas,</hi> and of his own the Jews; and here one of Chriſt's own Servants, in whom Chriſt had repoſed Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and truſted him with a part of his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 6. Chriſt expects increaſe, where he hath been ſcattering and ſtrawing, as here he had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 7. Diſtracting ſlaviſh fear is the natural fruit of an ill opinion of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 8. Diſtracting ſlaviſh fear is an effectual ſtop to induſtry and labour; when perſons are brought to ſay there is no hope, the effects are very ſad: This was <hi>David's</hi> fear, 2 Sam. 6.9. <hi>And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and ſaid, how ſhal the Ark of the Lord come to me?</hi> 1 Cron. 21.30. it ſtopt induſtry; <hi>But</hi> David <hi>could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid becauſe of the ſword of the Angel of the Lord.</hi> True Fear drives to duty; See <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> See <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11. Phil. 2.12. Work with fear and trembling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 9. That very bad and wicked reprobates may retain what they have received, and that with ſome eſteem, in a napkin; Oh then, how weak an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it of ſome who plead they are as true to their principles as ever they were!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part</hi> 10. The vulgar Latin reads <hi>Lo, behold;</hi> perſons are apt to bear hard with ſtrong confidence

                  <p>We have but one remarkable paſſage more to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle &amp; apply with reſpect to the ſlothful ſervant, and that is, our Lord's reply to the ſlothful Servants Plea and Defence, which you have laid down in the 24, 25. verſes: Now in theſe 26 and 27 verſes, we have our Lords reply, which divides it ſelf into two general Parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt his ill reſentment, appearing in his ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and Reproof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; his Judgment and Sentence ordained and pronounced againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; We have his ſevere rebuke and reproof, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. and then his Judgment and ſentence, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29, 30. I ſhall firſt indeavour to handle this Firſt part, which contains our Lords reply to what the ſlothful ſervant pleads for himſelf in the two former veries: and it is plain and clear that what he here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged and pleaded, is ſo far from ſatisfieing and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Lord that he reſents it exceeding ill, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe ſeveral Circumſtances following.</p>
                  <p>As Firſt, from the placing his rebuke, which he makes the prom or preface of what he had to ſay; his Lord breaks out in the firſt place with this his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of high diſſatisfaction in theſe words <hi>(thou wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſlothful ſervant)</hi> being in the frontiſpeice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; from the nature of this rebuke, which conſiſts in two emphatical epithetes, <hi>thou wicked and ſlothful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:33055:94"/>
                  <p>Thirdly; In the particular application in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>Thou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly; It appears in our Lords ironical upbraiding ſpeech to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. where our Lord in theſe words ſeems to be angry with the Servant.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly; it appears in his angry expoſtulation with him v. 27. ſhowing what he ought to have done.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly; in that he chargeth him with incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and inconſiſtency with his own knowledg and principle.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Whether our Lord be in good earneſt in theſe his words, <hi>Thou kneweſt?</hi> or, whether Chriſt doth only upbraid?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; What doth Chriſt intend, when he ſaith he ſhould have put his money to the exchangers?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly; in what ſenſe doth Chriſt palliate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Uſury between man and man?</p>
                  <p>Firſt; As to the two Epitheres the original word (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>male</hi>) tranſlated <hi>wicked,</hi> is a very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive word; it hath many acceptations in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as evil, naught, lewd, diſhoneſt, falſe, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteful, rude, unskilful: but in this place it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the worſt ſenſe: it is uſed to ſet out the worſt kind of wickedneſs, malice, and guile; it is to be underſtood in the Superlative degree. See <hi>Acts</hi> 18.14. <hi>wicked lewdneſs,</hi> the higheſt kind of evil that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding naught. In ſhort, the word is uſed to ſet out the wickedneſs of the Devil himſelf. See Mat. 13.38.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33055:95"/>
                     <hi>Children of the wicked one. So</hi> 1 Joh. 5. <hi>that wicked one touch him not; (Malignus)</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, thou moſt wicked, or thou malignant ill-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Our Lord doth not uſe this word but upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial occaſions: he uſeth it (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſervant that had 10000 Talents forgiven him who was ſo cruel to his fellow-Servant, <hi>Oh thou wicked Servant;</hi> So here <hi>thou wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what was the principal evil in this Servant that Chriſt referreth unto, which makes him ſpeak ſo ſharply to him as in this word? it will eaſily be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he might be called <hi>ſlothful,</hi> but why <hi>wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> There are four Capital evils in him; as firſt his ungratefulneſs and unanſwerableneſs to his Maſters Love. Secondly; his ſlighting carriage and terms. Thirdly; his ſafe and untrue charging his Lord. Fourthly; his impudent hardning his Face againſt his Lord.</p>
                  <p>In all this, firſt; his ungratefulneſs and unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to his Maſters love, and his high intruſtment of him: it was no ſmall favour that his Maſter ſhould intruſt him with a part of his eſtate to improve: Chriſt expected this ſervant ſhould have anſwered his love, and rendred ſuitable returns. The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of that ſervant we read of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. lay in this particular, not anſwering Love received. O ungrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is a high ſin, and greatly offends God and Chriſt. How ill did God take it at <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> hands, not rendring according to the benefit he had received 2 <hi>Cron,</hi> 32, 25. Therefore wrath broke out againſt him. It is wickedneſs to trample upon the mercies of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; wickedneſs conſiſts in ſlighting under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing terms of God and Chriſt. See the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. he <hi>contemns God.</hi> See
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33055:95"/>Job 22.27. <hi>They ſay, what can the Almighty do for us?</hi> Nah. 1.11. <hi>There is one come out of thee that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines evil againſt the Lord, a wicked counſellor:</hi> this was the ſin of the wicked Jews, unto whom Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. This was the ſin of <hi>Simon, Acts</hi> 8.22. he imagined meanly of the gift of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; his wickedneſs lay in his verbal falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of his Lord; this is one chief part of the Devils wickedneſs, from whence he is branded with falſe accuſing the brethren; it is one of his names, the part of a wicked man, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 10. That God can neither ſee nor hear. This was the wickedneſs of the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. that accuſed Chriſt that he caſt out Devils by the Devil; this was the wickedneſs that <hi>Job's</hi> friends thought him guilty of in charging God falſly: and for this Chriſt comes to judge the World, (<hi>Jude</hi> 15.) for hard ſpeeches: This was ſome part of the ſlothful Servants evil, he gave hard ſpeeches of his Lord.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; his wickedneſs is further aggravated by his pertinacy, ſtubbornneſs, frowardneſs, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: as we may perceive in the two former verſes, he hardens his face againſt his Lord; which is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a wicked perſon. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.12. <hi>A wicked perſon walketh with a froward mouth, Ch.</hi> 21.29. <hi>A wicked man hardeneth his face that is againſt God.</hi> So that we may eaſily perceive this Servant did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this epithete, <hi>thou wicked Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next word we are to inquire into is the word <hi>ſlothful,</hi> which is an emphatical word, it hath near 20 acceptations in Scripture, thou ſlothful, ſluggiſh, idle, dull, ſtopped, hard to be removed, loth to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; it ſignifies to delay, ſtand ſtill, and many more.

                  <p>The fifth thing to be ſpoken unto is, the word that our Lord makes uſe of to ſet out his return or advantage, he calls <hi>Uſury:</hi> from whence ſome gather incouragement to be Uſureres. The Lord in this word follows the former borrowed metaphors of money, and bank, and trading; ſo here Uſury. Great mens Stewards diſpoſe of their Lord's moneys to bankers in order to bring in increaſe. But this borrowing the word, doth not at all palliate or incourage the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſin of Uſury; no more than Chriſt making uſe of the unjuſt Steward for an example to provoke his Diſciples to make ſure their future eſtate, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his fraudulent dealings with his Maſter; all that Chriſt inſtanceth in as to the ways of man, doth not amount to a toleration of their ways; only from their manner, not matter doth Chriſt make teaching to us: that Uſury is lawful or unlawful cannot be urged from this Text; only this is true from hence, that Uſury, yea the largeſt increaſe, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, What is this <hi>taking away.</hi> The Greek word ſignifies to ſnatch, or take by violence.

But if we diligently obſerve the Parable, we ſhall find it all one to take his Talent from him, or him from his Talent.

The firſt Part of Chriſt's Sentence is, <hi>Depart,</hi> Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the preſence of Chriſt. This is that (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which we read of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. laſt, <hi>let him be accurſed when the Lord ſhall come.</hi> This is to ſhame and degrade him, and is the firſt part of his Sentence; as when one is degraded from his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity his Robes are ſtript off: contrary to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Godly, who ſhall ſtand in that day; ſet 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. his Talent is then taken away, when he is diſcovered to be an Hypocrite, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Secondly, To take away his Talent, ſuppoſeth his utter, total and eternal diſabling, from ever having opportunity of improving it again. This is the night coming when no man can work any more, his ſtock b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing taken away, now he muſt ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When doth this Judgment take place of taking away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> At the perſonal return of his Lord. This is plain in our contex, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. when Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Kingdom, and is returned; when the Bridegroom cometh, as before, the ſame is effected; when death cometh, it doth ceaſe. Indeed it happens
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33055:101"/>with ſome, that their Talent is taken away; either ſometimes it is loſt as to exerciſe, or elſe they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: but if the ſlothful eſcape with the Talent here, it will effectually be taken away when Chriſt comes, <hi>then ſhall every man have praiſe of God;</hi> this is the Time reſolv'd upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. when the Son of man comes in his Glory, and the holy Angels with him; — perſons may hold their Talents, or Intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or a ſhew of them till then.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As to the Executioners of this Law; <hi>Is it their fellow ſervants that muſt take the Talent away?</hi> No, it is plain that the Angels are the Servants, thoſe that ſtand by Chriſt in that his coming: therefore when he cometh he is attended with all his Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.39. &amp; 41.49. The Angels are the Reapers, they gather out of Chriſt's Kingdom that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, they ſever the Wicked from amongſt the Juſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Why given to him that hath ten?</hi> this is ſo ſtrange a Circumſtance that the Servants the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not able to underſtand; <hi>Luke</hi> 19.25. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he hath ten.</hi> This ſeems ſtrange. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Chriſt recites the Law in that caſe; for, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;</hi> he that was able to improve much, ſhall have much more. This Circumſtance cannot be underſtood properly, that the faithful Servants of Chriſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive addition from thoſe that are wicked: but the Moral to us-ward is, to ſet forth the great eſteem Chriſt hath to Induſtry, and his palpable ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the contrary. The ſcope of this paſſage is to teach us that the evils and imquities of ſome Profeſſors ſhall much and greatly redound to thoſe that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently righteous. This is God's way to ſet the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Righteous againſt the wickedneſs of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33055:102"/>the Wicked, that ſo their Righteouſneſs may ſhine. So he did by <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ah</hi> in his day, he magnifies <hi>Noah</hi>'s righteouſneſs from the wickedneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> others, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.7. We have four expreſſions in <hi>Noah</hi>'s caſe in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 1. It is ſaid, <hi>but Noah found Grace;</hi> 2. <hi>Build thee an Ark;</hi> 3. <hi>I eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee;</hi> 4. <hi>Thee have I ſeen righteous.</hi> Theſe are ſingularly ſpoken to <hi>Noah,</hi> and of him, in oppoſition to the reſt. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. thoſe that went aſtray with the Idolaters advanced the praiſe of thoſe who were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful So doth Chriſt take from <hi>Iſrael</hi> to give unto the <hi>Centurion, I have not found ſo great faith no not in Iſrael.</hi> This is uſual with Men too as with reſpect to Chrildren and Servants, to make the faults of one to contribute to the others praiſe. So here, let him that is ſo worthy be made more worthy. So it is plain, that ſome who have had large Intruſtments from Chriſt, and have improved them, ſhall ſhine as the Sun, ſhall have very large Returns; though thoſe that have leaſt ſhall have enough, yet this is a truth, That ſome ſhall abound in Glory beyond others, one Star ſhall differ from another.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly; <hi>How may we reconcile this ſeeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to take from him that he hath not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; It is true in both ſenſes: <hi>he hath, he hath not;</hi> he hath in Stock, he hath nothing in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. He that hath Grace or Gifts, and doth not improve them, is ſo like him that hath none, that he may fitly bear the name of not having. To have, is to improve and put forth. We have an Argument in common, <hi>That which appears not, is not.</hi> So here, he that manifeſts no Grace, is equal with him that hath none: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Let us have Grace, that we may ſerve God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:33055:102"/>
                  <p>Sixthly; <hi>How is this Servant unprofitable? this is the Epithet put upon him here: Why unprofitable,</hi> may ſome ſay? <hi>was it poſſible, let him have done what he would or could, to be profitable? are we not taught to ſay, When we have done all, we are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, If he that had done all he could, was an unprofitable Servant, then much more him that comes ſhort of what was commanded muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: Though we cannot profit God by what we do, yet we may profit men like our ſelves; here is unprofitable. But I rather think this term is made uſe of to accommodate the Parable, as before he is ſaid to <hi>require his own with Uſury</hi> or advantage; ſo this term <hi>profit,</hi> anſwers to ſuch a dialect of ſpeaking. It is falſe and wicked to ſay, we can profit God; this is that which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> inſinuates againſt <hi>Job,</hi> Job 22. <hi>Can a man be profitable to God?</hi> the anſwer is in the Negative, <hi>No.</hi> And as it is wickedneſs to ſay, we can profit God by what we do; ſo it is alſo to ſay, Obedience and Induſtry in Spirituals do not profit our ſelves. <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Is not man profitable unto God? why then are God's People called God's Treaſure, and his Portion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſw. 1. They may be ſo called from that high eſteem he bears to his People. 2dly, It is true, that God is exceedingly pleaſed, though not profited: that he is mightily pleaſed appears from <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37. He will gird himſelf, and come forth and ſerve them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>What may we underſtand in this part of the puniſhment, referring to the poſitive puniſhment of ſence,</hi> 1. <hi>Caſt him,</hi> 2 dly, <hi>into darkneſs,</hi> 3dly, <hi>utter darkneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:33055:103"/>
                  <p>I anſw. 1. To caſt, implies a violent caſting with deteſtation; as it is uſed by Chriſt elſewhere: <hi>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee;</hi> Thus the Lord is ſaid to caſt out the Nations.</p>
                  <p>But 2dly, <hi>Why into Darkneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We read of Darkneſs in Scripture under a twofold Conſideration; 1. Proper and natural; 2. Improper and metaphorical Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Natural Darkneſs, occaſioned by withdrawing the Sun, or by its Eclipſe. Such a Darkneſs was upon <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. called <hi>an hour of Darkneſs.</hi> It is one of the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 11.1. This is a ſore Judgment, this is the Darkneſs that <hi>Job</hi> wiſheth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day he was born in, <hi>Job</hi> 3. This Darkneſs we reade of at the time of Chriſt's Crucifixion; and it is a ſad and dreadful Judgment.</p>
                  <p>But 2dly, we have Darkneſs metaphorically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and that under a four-fold Conſideration: 1. The natural unregenerate ſtate of ſin; ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>ye were Darkneſs.</hi> 2. A ſtate of Darkneſs in the underſtanding; this was the ſtate of the Gentiles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. 3. Death is a ſtate of Darkneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 17.13. Death is the dark bed. 4. Darkneſs is put for the moſt deep and diſmal ſtate of Sorrow; as Joy is a ſtate of Light, ſo is Sorrow a ſtate of Darkneſs. A ſtate of Joy is a lightſom ſtate, oppoſed to Darkneſs: ſee <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. So, 2dly, the depth of Sorrow is ſtiled Darkneſs; ſee <hi>Job</hi> 19.8. <hi>He hath ſet Darkneſs in my paths,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> that is, Sorrow of the deepeſt ſort. And <hi>Job</hi> 30.26. <hi>I looked for Light, and behold Darkneſs.</hi> See <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>all his dayes he eateth in Darkneſs.</hi> Now all theſe metaph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33055:103"/>this Darkneſs is comprehenſive of unſpeakable Sorrow and Affliction, when the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſets forth the eternal puniſhment on the worſt of ſinners, this is it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. laſt, he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall be driven to Darkneſs.</hi> This is the puniſhment appointed for the unbelieving, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12.) of him without the wedding-garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.13. Of thoſe lapſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. It is the Darkneſs of the lapſed Angels, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. All their puniſhment is ſaid to be Darkneſs. So this unprofitable Servant's is Darkneſs.</p>

                  <p>We may ſum up the whole of theſe verſes into theſe four Parts, or Heads.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. We have the Examination, Tryal, and final Sentence upon both Numbers according to their Works.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:33055:108"/>
                  <p>That which lieth firſt in order before us is the firſt of theſe Heads, which is a third Relation of Chriſt's ſecond Coming. We had two before in this Chapter, firſt, His Coming under the capacity of a Bridegroom; Secondly, as a Lord or Nobleman; and here, as a glorious King on his Throne.</p>
                  <p>Now we have in this Relation of Chriſt's ſecond Coming four Circumſtances conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Capacity that He then comes in, which is as <hi>Son of man.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. The great Attendants He ſhall have in this day; all the Holy Angels.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in this Appearance of His, He ſhall place Himſelf upon a Glorious Throne. Of theſe briefly in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He comes <hi>as Son of man,</hi> which is not an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Epithet. Jeſus Chriſt is near an hundred times in Scripture ſtiled <hi>Son of man;</hi> not half ſo many <hi>Son of God:</hi> and as often is this title applied to him upon his ſecond Coming, as upon any other account. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.27, 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. chap. 19. chap. 22. &amp; 21.27, 36, and many times more. So it is plain, that when Chriſt comes again, He comes as Son of Man. That Jeſus Chriſt ſhall aſſume this N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which will be more needful to inſiſt upon, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>Why it may be thought he doth ſo often render himſelf under this capacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is ſtiled <hi>Son of man,</hi> to ſhew the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reality of his Perſon; Son of Man, and Man is the ſame. That He ſhall come as a Man in this day, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>He ſhall judge the World by that

                  <p>This may ſerve to inform us of the vaſt difference as to the Glory between Chriſt's firſt and ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In his firſt Coming he had no glory upon him: it was propheſied <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. that he ſhould come <hi>without Beauty, or form, or comelineſs;</hi> then there was no outward glory or deſirableneſs in him; He came mean and poor every way, as to the outward; in his ſecond Coming he ſhall be cloathed with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

                  <p>The third Circumſtance in this his Coming is, His Attendance the Angels. I had occaſion to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this before in the former verſe, when I ſhewed you that the Angels ſhould be Chriſt's ſubord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<list>
                        <item>1. The Certainty of their coming with him.</item>
                        <item>2. Their Number.</item>

                  <p>But ſome may object from <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. <hi>He chargeth his Angels with folly,</hi> which in Scripture-language is as much as to ſay with ſin.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Some here underſtand this to be ſpoken of the bad Angels which fell; they he might well charge with ſin: But this cannot be the meaning of it. 2. Some underſtand the good Angels. 3. But others think neither good nor bad, as underſtood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but with reſpect to the nature of Angels; he chargeth the Angelical nature with ſin, becauſe a Regiment of them fell. But I think it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood comparatively compared with God who is holy in the abſtract, They are chargeable with fully, becauſe there is none holy as the Lord; As there is none immortal as Him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. He <hi>only hath immortality;</hi> ſo He only is holy. So that it may be true that the Angels of themſelves may be holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Text, and yet in compariſon with God chargeable with folly.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a glorious and large Attendance ſhall Chriſt have when he comes!

                  <p>I urge in the third place this; That at no one time ſhall there be ſuch a gathering to Chriſt to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for we read in Scripture of two general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>

                  <p>5th Queſt. <hi>Why doth Chriſt ſtile them Sheep and Goats, ſeing they are all Chriſtians in profeſſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſw. firſt, Becauſe Goats were always reckoned clean beaſts, fit for Sacrifice under the Law as well as Sheep; therefore theſe bad Profeſſors may be called Goats, comparatively clean. Chriſt doth not ſet them
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33055:117"/>forth by Dogs, Bears, or Lions, but Goats.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> to ſet out the difference in nature that was between them though both in the Flock or Church. A Sheep is of one nature, and a Goat of another. Theſe Profeſſors differ much in their natures, as a Goat from a Sheep.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Goats are taken in here as well as Sheep, to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w the particular charge that Chriſt hath of them both, the Goats as well as the Sheep, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, <hi>Goats</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> becauſe though they were both in one Flock, yet the Goats were the worſt in nature. There is much difference as to the worthineſs of Sheep and Goats in nature; the Goats are not ſo profitable as the Sheep: therefore although the Goats are clean creatures, yet the Sheep were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as the beſt, and commonly in Scripture na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med firſt. So much for the fifth Queſtion by way of Explication.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Circumſtance to be explained is, <hi>What may be here underſtood by right and left hand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Right and leſt hand is ſometimes taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, ſometimes improperly and figuratively, in Scriptures: when it is taken improperly and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly, it implies great Power, or a powerful hand; So <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>The Right hand of the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108. &amp; <hi>Pſa.</hi> 138. <hi>Let thy Right hand ſave me;</hi> that is, thy ſtrong hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly; Sometimes ſignificantly, a place of pleaſure and delight is underſtood God's right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. Sometimes the right and left hand of Chriſt are properly to be underſtood; as in that requeſt of the Mother of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Sons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20, 21. <hi>Grant
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33055:118"/>that theſe my two Sons may ſit one on the right hand, and the other on the left in thy Kingdom.</hi> Where we may underſtand both places <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be places of Honour, but moſt commonly the right hand is underſtood the place of higheſt Honour; So <hi>Jacob</hi> underſtood it in his bleſſing <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Sons. But by right and left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in our Text, it may be underſtood properly; as Chriſt is perſonally conſidered as Son of Man in this his day, ſo He hath right and left hand: And as we do properly give the right or upper hand to thoſe whom we bear eſteem unto, ſo here it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, a place of high eſteem; and under that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration Chriſt is ſaid to be ſet at God's right hand, that is, he place of high eſteem: but I need not dwell upon this, I ſhall only add a few words of Application to the whole, and ſo proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This doth inform us where Chriſt when he is in his Glory on his Throne, attended with his Angels, will begin, namely at his own Houſe, his own Servants, his own Flock; and thereto the words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> may properly be applied (though there is more in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. A very amicable loving ſweet Countenance; ſo <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> paraphraſing on this verſe and ſaluting, ſaith, <hi>He to the ſort on the right hand, with a mild and merry chear, ſhall ſay, Come my Friends, whom the World counted vile and execrable, but my Father counts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and praiſe-worthy.</hi> So he.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Salutation was ſpoken with much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour to them unto whom it was ſpoken, it was with bowing and worſhip to thoſe unto whom they ſpake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This reſpect was given as they having received it firſt from God; as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, I eſteem and honour you becauſe my Father honoureth you; you are not only bleſt by me in this capacity, but my Father hath determined this Bleſſing to reſt upon you.</p>
                  <p>But 3dly, <hi>Why is this Kingdom ſaid to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared?</hi>

                  <p>I anſw.

The Saints were to have Reſt when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels. As alſo our Text is plain. And it cannot be rationally thought that the Saints ſhall have Kingdom before Chriſt, they are not to expect it before Him, the Reign of the Saints is contemporary with Chriſt's; neither can it be ſuppoſed that they ſhall have it before they have paſt Chriſt's Bar, and are acquitted by Him.

                  <p>From the whole of this Context I ſhall lay down theſe Nine obſervable Parts from the Connexion of the verſes:</p>
                  <p>Part 1. That the true demonſtration of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Election to glory is through our obedience and Friendſhip to Chriſt, prepared for you ſo qualified: <hi>choſen in him before the foundation of the World,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirt, and belief of the truth,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>elect through Sanctification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Part. 2. It is our Lords way in his dealings and proceedings with men, to render a reaſon of his ſo proceeding with them.</p>
                  <p>Part. 3. Jeſus Chriſt in his diſtributious to men in Judgment, hath a ſpecial eye to their works reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</p>
                  <p>Part. 4. That works of mercy, charity, and almes, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>r a ſuperintendency over all works and duties whatſoever, as to acceptance with God, and profit to our ſelves in time to come.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:33055:129"/>
                  <p>Part. 5. That it is incident to Chriſts dear friends and brethren, to ſuffer hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, and all manner of diſtreſſes whilſt on earth.</p>
                  <p>Part. 6. Jeſus Chriſt in his Celeſtial glory at the right hand of his Father doth eſpouſe the ſtate of his Diſciples and Saints here on earth.</p>
                  <p>Part. 7. It is the nature of one truly acceptable to Chriſt to diſclaim all worthineſs in themſelves, they ſee no ſuch worth as Chriſt ſeeth in them.</p>
                  <p>Part. 8. Jeſus Chriſt doth record and regiſter each particular action of charity proceeding from one Saint to another, if but a draught of drink.</p>
                  <p>Part. 9. The pooreſt Saint, or true believer, in his loweſt ſtate and Condition is by Chriſt owned as his brother.</p>
                  <p>Of each of theſe parts I ſhall ſpeak a few words briefly, and haſten to finiſh this paragraph.</p>

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:33055:130"/>30, 31, 32. The Uſe that we may make from this Part to our ſelves, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From hence be inſtructed to meaſure your Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by your effectual Calling and Converſion.

Are ye of thoſe that the Kingdom is prepared for before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World? you may know it by this: you are prepared alſo, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24.

                  <p n="2">2.

                     </gap>he former. And beſides, this Truth is ſo apparent, that the very current of Scriptures contribute to the proof of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. We have a cloud of witneſſes as to this Part, the recompence from God to Men is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their works, whether good or evil. This Rule was ſtated by God at the firſt in the dayes of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> when we read of but two men in the World, Gen. 4.7. <hi>If thou doſt well, thou ſhalt be accepted, if evil, ſin,</hi> or puniſhment, <hi>lyeth at the door.</hi> This Rule God proceeds by to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. <hi>For becauſe thou haſt done this thing, therefore will I bleſs thee.</hi> If any one queſtion the truth of this Part, let them read theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rev</hi> 2.23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.12. and by the taking in theſe Scriptures, I hope you will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſatisfied of the truth of this Part.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome will be ready to Object, That if God rewards men according to their works, and men have only what they work for, where then is Grace? <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by Grace, not by Works.</hi>

                     </gap>here given by Chriſt, which doth center in Charity; the Part was this, That Mercy, Charity and Almes extended to Chriſts true brethren whilſt here on earth, is above all ſervices acceptable to God, and brings in greateſt profit to a perſon at Chriſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, theſe ſervices of Charity are ſuperintendent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other ſervices whatſoever in Chriſtians.

                  <p>I ſhall therefore lay down ten Qualifications or Conditions in our Charity, or Alms neceſſary as to God's acceptance, and our own profit, which are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thou wouldeſt find this Remembrance, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and Profit, <hi>do thy Alms ſecretly.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this was the manner of thoſe in the Text, for they could not remember they had done any ſuch thing; therefore they had not deſigned obſervation or praiſe of men. This is one of thoſe Rules given by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. deſign ſecretly, <hi>not to be ſeen of Men;</hi> provided God ſees, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, In thy Alms, to the end it may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:33055:134"/>taken, do it cheerfully, not grudgingly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>God loves a chearful giver,</hi> that doth it as to the Lord himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, If thou beeſt able, be rich in good works: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be rich in good works.</hi> It doth not pleaſe God, for one richly bleſt in this world, to be poor and ſcanty in good Works. When Chriſt makes a promiſe to reward a cup of cold water, it muſt be underſtood that this is anſwerable to his poor ability: for <hi>where much is given, there much is required.</hi> The poor widow is by Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for her two mites, becauſe it was what ſhe had, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly, In Charity and Alms we muſt give our own, not rob others, oppreſs or abuſe others to give: we are not obliged to borrow to give; we are, as we have received, to give: <hi>Job</hi> cloathed the poor with the fleece of his ſheep. <hi>Solomon</hi> counſels thee to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="5">5ly, If we would have our Charity acceptable, we muſt be ſpeedy in it, not delay to do our almes. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.28. <hi>ſay not to thy neighbour go and Come again, when thou haſt it by thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6ly, Thou muſt do thy alms with diſcretion ſo as it may be moſt anſwering to his needs and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Thus it is ſaid of the charitable man, Pſal. 1 12.5. <hi>he guides his affairs with diſcretion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7ly; In our alms and Charity we muſt do them with ſimplicity, not with partiality: though an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, one that hath done thee wrong, yet relieve him.

                        </gap> me nothing.</hi> We ought to give in love to God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10ly; They muſt be univerſally and conſtantly. We are Commanded to be ready to every good word at all times: not like the ſtony ground, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. for a ſeaſon, and not continue. Charity with theſe qualifications hath its ſuperintendency of all duties of obedience whatſoever; for Mercy is more acceptable then Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>why is almes ſo acceptable, and ſo exhorted unto above all duties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt; Becauſe a man in no works doth ſo reſemble God and Chriſt, as in Charity; therefore it is called for, Math. 5.16. <hi>that we might be like our heavenly Father.</hi> Luke. 6.35. <hi>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father alſo is merciful.</hi> This makes <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to the elders of the Church of Epheſus, Acts 20. <hi>that it is a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive;</hi> becauſe moſt like God, who gives all, but receives nothing; a charitable perſon bears the image of God moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Almes and Charity to Chriſts diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is ſo acceptable to God, from that tender love that God bears to his poor members. Parents love thoſe who ſhew love to their Children; and from
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:33055:135"/>the Love that Parents have to their Children, they Love to ſee them ſhew Love to each other. Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are as near and dear to him as the apple of his eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Becauſe if Alms be done as they ought to be done, they be a true demonſtration of our Love to Chriſt; and he loves them that love him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Works of Charity do choicely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a perſon to ſit looſe from preſent things; the Contrary whereof is Covetouſneſs, which the Lord abhorreth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that I am to ſpeak unto, is, to ſet forth who are the proper objects of our Charity in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to acceptance with God and Chriſt. Which I ſhall ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively:</hi> not idle or ſlothful perſons. See what <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith as to that, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle diſcourſes his thorow diſlike to ſuch, and declares his Apoſtolical In junction in that Caſe, which was, <hi>that thoſe which would not work, neither ſhould they eat.</hi> We are not to feed ſuch, though they ſhould be hungry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; <hi>affirmatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt; we muſt chiefly and principally relieve thoſe who do moſt lively bear the image of God, in point of holineſs; they muſt be ſo like Chriſt, as he may ſay another day, <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat.</hi> That was the rule that <hi>David</hi> obſerved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. he extended his Charity to thoſe who excelled in vertue. So <hi>Math.</hi> 10. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. the ground is becauſe they belong to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; your Charity muſt in the firſt place, and moſt ſtrongly run out to thoſe whoſe hunger, thirſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>akedneſs and impriſonment is for Chriſts ſake; in ſo
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33055:136"/>doing, you do moſt properly relieve Chriſt: relie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to ſuch ſo ſuffering, brings acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To thoſe who ſucceed Chriſt in the work of the miniſtry on earth; in order to ſuch doth Chriſt ſpeak in ſpecial manner, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.40. <hi>he that receiveth you, receiveth me,</hi> ſuch (ſaith Chriſt) are worthy of their meat: to ſuch eſpecially doth <hi>John</hi> direct <hi>Gaius</hi> to ſhew Charity 3 <hi>John</hi> 7.8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that for his names ſake they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles. We therefore ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch, that we might be fellow-helpers of the truth; ſuch are, or ought above all, to carry the moſt lively image of Chriſt, and may bear the name of Chriſt's brethren. Take an example how acceptable this ſort of Charity was to God from the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.8. from the Shunamitiſh woman to the prophet of the Lord who built a chamber, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him a bed, ſtool, table, Candleſtick: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e the favour of God to her. 1. She hath a Child paſt age, and hope; 2. When this Child died it is raiſed to life again as a requital of this Charity (as is plain in the Context.) The Uſe of this part may be firſt for Exhortation; Labour to be in a capacity to diſcharge this duty ſo acceptable to God; take pains in honeſt ways, that thou maiſt have wherewith to do good. See the Exhortation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, Maintain honeſt Trades,</hi> as it may be read, <hi>to this end.</hi> So Eph. 4.28. <hi>Labour, working with your hands, that you may have to give to him that needs.</hi> And this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is not only to Members, but Preachers and Elders: for <hi>it is a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive,</hi> in them. If this be ſo acceptable a ſervice then let us labour to be found in it: who would not do that which will pleaſe God? this is a Sacrifice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:33055:136"/>God is well pleaſed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Study the great profit, the certain and infallible profit of this duty: the return is ſure and great, and it is not forgot: Chriſt remembers every part and action from this root. As you have opportunity do good to all, but eſpecially to the houſhould of faith: make you friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs. Works of Charity are of exceeding eſteem with Chriſt, as appears by his bringing them forth at this day of his glory: for, <hi>I was an hungred, and a thirſt, and naked,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Part was this, That our Lord keeps a particular record of the good deeds performed by his Servants. Our Lord ſeems here to take pleaſure to particularize in every action one and other; it doth not only pleaſe him to ſay, becauſe you were chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſo take it by the great, but he doth enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate and ſhew wherein. He doth not ſtop at this, that they are ſheep, that they are righteous, but each particular action ſhall be brought out. When God of old would ſet out <hi>Job</hi> to the beſt advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth not only in the general ſay, he was a Godly man, but three times over he doth delineate him in ſeveral particulars: 1. he is <hi>perfect:</hi> 2. <hi>upright:</hi> 3. <hi>one that fears God:</hi> 4. <hi>one that eſcheweth evil:</hi> 5. he maintains this integrity, being tryed: 6. this he doth beyond all other men in that day, and in thoſe parts. So for works; ſee how Chriſt commends the Churches in particulars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. of Epheſus he ſaith, <hi>I know thy works, labour, patience, thou canſt not bear with thoſe that are evil; thou haſt tryed theſe that ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not; and haſt not fainted.</hi> So of <hi>Thyatira, verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>I know thy works, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33055:137"/>Service, Faith, and the last more than thy firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord doth this with a deſign to magnifie the virtues and ſervices of his Children, that their graces might look to the beſt advantage and largeſt magnitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This the Lord doth to ſet forth his diſtinct knowledg of what we do; not only doth he know in general, but in particular.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His goodneſs that he will not let ſlip the leaſt ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſet forth his exact Righteouſneſs, he records, that he may reward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This may ſerve for a ſpur to induſtry in all good duties, they ſhall not any of them be forgotten. If we cannot do the great if we do the leſs, it ſhall be rewarded. The farthing is not forgotten, given by the widow <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. This may ſerve for a Check to hypocriſie; we need not Covet to be ſeen of men, we ſee the leaſt act or ſervice done to Chriſt ſhall be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bar. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. God will then make man confeſs the hidden things of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. From hence we may read the tender love that Chriſt bears to his diſciples that he takes ſuch pleaſure to bring over each of their actions as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do of their children: they are not content to ſay he is a good Child, but ſet it out in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. From hence we may be informed that Chriſt will proceed by the ſame rule againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Pſal. 50. God <hi>will ſet their ſins in order before them:</hi> and ſo, <hi>Jude</hi> 14.15. not only ſhall their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deeds, but their hard ſpeeches ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. So in the following verſes we find, that Chriſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33055:137"/>doth as well and as particularly enumerate the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects of the Goats as of the performance of the ſheep. We now proceed to the 6th Point implyed in the text which was this, That the loweſt pooreſt moſt indigent wanting ſtate in outwards is incident to the deareſt choiceſt and moſt acceptable Saints, Chriſts brethren; not only to be without poſſeſſions, lands, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but without meat and drink, and dwelling-place: perſons are ſometimes accounted poor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to Rich when they have but from hand to mouth, nor to ſpare. But our Text ſpeaks of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of poverty, thirſty, naked, the loweſt ſtate herein is incident to the beſt of Saints, ſuch as Chriſt may own, and be content they ſhould perſonate him. <hi>I was a hungry, I was a thirſt, I was a ſtranger.</hi> The truth of this Part appears from what Chriſt ſpoke by way of preparation before hand to his diſciples to arm them from ſuch a ſtate: therefore Chriſt foretels the poor to be the ſubjects of the Goſple-Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.5. <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel: ye ſhall have the poor alwayes with you. Mat.</hi> 26.11. and Chriſt was ſent <hi>to preach the goſpel to the poor,</hi> Luke. 4. <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom,</hi> Jam. 2.5. Doth not this preparative ſaying of Chriſt &amp; his Servants, ſuppoſe ſuch a ſtate to be the ſtate of choice Chriſtians, and the beſt of them ſuch as are rich in faith? But Secondly, to prove this Part we have matter of Fact; this hath been the ſtate of the beſt; <hi>David</hi> himſelf at ſome turns ſuſtained hunger believing, but we have a lively inſtance of this ſtate in the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, yet liable to the great extremity of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. <hi>We both hunger, thirſt, and are naked, having no certain dwelling-place.</hi> Here we have this holy precious Saint exerciſed with four of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33055:138"/>theſe diſtreſſes in our text. See again 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>in wearineſs and painfulneſs, watchings often, in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, in faſtings,</hi> (we moſt not here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand religious faſtings, but faſtings for want of food) <hi>in cold and nakedneſs.</hi> And this was ſo common a Condition, as that it grew Cuſtomary unto him, <hi>Phi.</hi> 4.12. <hi>I have learned to be full and to be hungry.</hi> We read of a <hi>Lazarus</hi> yet worthy of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Boſom, though a beggar at <hi>Dives</hi> gate. Yet I would not be miſtaken in this, as if I encouraged a trade of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; I fear there are but few of our common beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of this ſtamp; I dare not allow it. It is true, <hi>David</hi> begged once or twice in ſome particular neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but not conſtantly. I think the generation that make a trade of begging, are the worſt of people and ſuch as God allows not; they are under ſuch a curſe as the poſterity of <hi>Judas,</hi> which was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a ſevere Judgment, Pſal. 10 9, 10. <hi>let his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be vagabonds and beg, let them ſeek their bread.</hi> There are ſome poor whom God is ſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take care of, theſe are the poor we have in our text, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 34. <hi>this poor man cryed.</hi> There is a Congregation of poor who may be ſtiled <hi>Gods poor, Pſal.</hi> 74. I might urge the ſtate of our Lord Chriſt who was poor for our ſakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. he had no habitation many times, he was hungry, and thirſty.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>but why doth God expoſe his dear ſervants to ſuch a ſtate,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> from a three-fold ground. Firſt, with reſpect to themſelves; Secondly, with reſpect to himſelf; Thirdly, with reſpect to his brethren.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, As to themſelves, 1. God doth it to humble them, who many times are not able to bear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This is the reaſon that God renders, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8, he ſuffered them to hunger and thirſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:33055:138"/>
                     <hi>to humble them to prove them.</hi> 2. To teach <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to live by Faith; therefore they muſt have but from hand to mouth, their daily bread; to make them know that <hi>man ſhall not live by bread alone, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by every word that cometh out of the mouth of God.</hi> 3. To make them reliſh future mercy, the land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Milk and Honey, that he might do them good in their latter end, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. Heavenly things are ſweet to a poor hungry Soul rightly qualified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. God doth this to try thoſe that are rich, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will do their duty; they were born for ſuch a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.17. <hi>a brother is born for adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:</hi> by this way God tryes their love and ſincerity to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee theſe texts, 2 Cor 8.9. chap. 9.13. Phil. 4. <hi>Not</hi> (ſaith St. Paul) <hi>that I deſire a gift, but fruit that might abound upon your account.</hi> Thus we, from good reaſons known to God, know Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſuch as may be very acceptable to him, and yet may be very poor as to outwards.</p>
                  <p>Object. But it is not ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>The Lyons ſhall ſuffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord ſhall want no good thing?</hi> From hence we may gather, that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall not be the ſtate of thoſe that fear God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. All that is promiſed in that place, is, that <hi>they ſhall want no good thing;</hi> but ſometimes hunger is good for them that fear God, as you have ſeen from <hi>Deut</hi> 8. this Part may teach us not to meaſure Gods ſpecial love by his dealing to thee in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; one that God is angry with may flouriſh in this World, whilſt one whom he dearly loves may want bread. Doth not <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſay <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. that <hi>all things come a like to all?</hi> yet how often are perſons apt to meaſure the favour of God by theſe his dealings?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This may help to bear up the hearts of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33055:139"/>righteous perſons: be not diſcouraged under pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and a low eſtate, ſtudy that word, <hi>James</hi> 2.5. <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this World, rich in Faith and heirs of the Kingdom.</hi> Study the ſtate of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, he was often hungry, though the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If thy eſtate in the world be low, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is a ſpecial duty lyeth upon thee in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Condition to live by Faith, and to be content. God took it very ill of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he brought them into a low eſtate in the wilderneſs, and they did not believe, but murmured againſt him. Learn that leſſon that St. <hi>Paul</hi> learnt, Phil. 4. <hi>in all eſtates to be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the end I might diſpatch this paragraph accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promiſe with brevity, I ſhall only touch two Parts more, and ſo conclude; the one reſpects the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of the righteous to Chriſts reaſons rendred, the other reſpects the reply of our Lord to take it off by way of explanation: wherein we have a worthy Part, though but implyed, ſuppoſing the relation that theſe ſtand in to Chriſt his brethren. The 2 parts are theſe. Firſt, <hi>That it is the nature of a truly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſon in Chriſt's account, to have a mean and low eſteem of their beſt performances for acceptance with Chriſt and Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second part is this, <hi>That true believers in Chriſt Jeſus, though poor and deſpicable in the World, yet ſtand related to Chriſt and his brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A righteous perſon is ready to diſclaim his own righteouſneſs for Salvation.</hi> In handling this Part I ſhall, 1. Indeavour to Confirm the truth of this part from Scripture: 2. anſwer an objection foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on ſome ſeeming Contrary Scriptures: 3. give two conſiderable reaſons: 4. make ſome Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to the truth of it. There is a vaſt difference
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:33055:139"/>between a righteous and a wicked man in this reſpect, a <hi>Saul</hi> will juſtifie his diſobedience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.20. but a righteous <hi>Job</hi> will not juſtifie his righteouſneſs, it muſt be forced upon him: as here, our Lord draws the emblem of a righteous and naked perſon to the life, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. under the name of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican:</hi> the Phariſee thinks himſelf righteous, and doth pertinaciouſly plead it; <hi>I faſt twice in the week, I pay tithes of all that I poſſeſs:</hi> he boaſts of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the Publican ſeeth nothing in himſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy taking notice of. See what frame of Spirit <hi>David</hi> is in, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. <hi>What am I, or my Fathers houſe?</hi> 2 Chron. 29.14. he ſees nothing in himſelf. So <hi>Job</hi> is full to this purpoſe, who is a man Juſtified by God to be one perfect or upright; one that <hi>feared God,</hi> and <hi>eſcheweth evil;</hi> yet he can ſee no ſuch thing: Job. 9.15. <hi>whom if I were righteous I would not anſwer.</hi> Job 40.4. <hi>behold I am vile,</hi> yet a perfect man in Gods eſteem, a very charitable man, <hi>chap.</hi> 29. in his own underſtanding when he was to deal with man. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> a man <hi>greatly beloved of God,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not our ſuplications in our own name.</hi> And this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>ſay, when ye have done all, we are unprofitable Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is objected, <hi>Do we not find three eminent Servants of God pleading their own righteouſneſs,</hi> Nehemiah, David, Hezekiah, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my good deeds:</hi> Pſal. <hi>God rewarded me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my righteouſneſs, and the cleanneſs of my hands:</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Remember how I have walked before thee with a perfect heart,</hi> done that which is right in thy ſight; doth not theſe ſpeeches ſavour of another Spirit? thus <hi>Job</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I ſhould juſtifie my ſelf, my own mouth would condemn me, then if I ſhould ſay I were perfect, it would prove me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:33055:140"/>See what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt mark iniquity, who can ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 143.2. <hi>In thy ſight ſhall no fleſh be justified.</hi> Now how ſhall we reconcile theſe two ſorts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To reconcile which, we muſt diligently conſider the different acceptation of righteouſneſs in Scripture:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Righteouſneſs as to Actions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Righteouſneſs as to Perſons; and this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under a two-fold oppoſition:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is Righteouſneſs in oppoſition to Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, Righteouſneſs in oppoſition to imperfection; and in that abſtracted ſenſe, <hi>there is none righteous, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3.10. no man righteous in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract; nor no man righteous in God's ſight, but by interpretation and imputation, as God pleaſeth to accept in Chriſt. But let us examine thoſe three inſtances, of <hi>Nehemiah, David,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 13. the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good deeds done by him, which he pleads, were comparatively to be conſidered as he was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as he pleads, Chap. 5.15. The other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours were chargeable, ſo was not I, <hi>becauſe of the fear of the Lord.</hi> So that Comparatively he could plead Righeouſneſs, that he was more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than his Predeceſſors: yet this plea of his is with <hi>an eye to God's Righteouſneſs in the multitude of his mercies,</hi> as Ver. 22. which doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18. <hi>He hath reſpect to his Righteouſneſs,</hi> as to <hi>Saul,</hi> and in that caſe he had been righteous as to him, and that <hi>Saul</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:33055:140"/>to confeſs that he was more righteous than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and according to this Righteouſneſs of his, God had now rewarded him, in giving him the Kingdom, he had patiently waited, and not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly haſty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38. He being ſuddenly ſurprized with a dreadful threatning and following ſickneſs, ſo ſuddenly upon a choice manifeſtation of Love and Zeal for God's Name in the buſineſs of <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> was amazed to think what might be the cauſe (that is to ſay, the extraordinary cauſe) and he could upon ſearch find no immediate Cauſe, but rather the contrary; therefore upon this he weeps, and pleads with God <hi>as to his walkings and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart,</hi> not <hi>for Heaven and Glory:</hi> but he pleads what he pleads in order to an addition to his dayes <hi>in the Land of the living.</hi> The like we ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 39. As to <hi>Abimelech</hi> for his mercy ſhewed to <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> And theſe very men upon a general view of their beſt actions, were very humble: and it is one thing to put God in mind Hiſtorically of what they have done, and another thing to claim acceptance merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly for them done.</p>
                  <p>But we have two Reaſons, why truly righteous perſons look ſo meanly on their own beſt Duties of Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch perſons have alwayes before their eyes the pure Majeſty of God and his Glory, this humbles. <hi>Job</hi> 9. This makes him ſay, <hi>Though I were righteous, yet would not I lift up my head, but make ſupplication to my Judg,</hi> ſaith Job, <hi>thou art my Judg.</hi> This ſight of God did make <hi>Job abhor himſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Chap. 42. <hi>Becauſe his eyes had ſeen God.</hi> So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is humbled at the ſight of the Majeſty of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. <hi>I am undone, I am a man of unclean
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:33055:141"/>lips.</hi> This ſight ſtrikes an awe upon the Righteous as it doth here on theſe in our Text: Theſe ſee Chriſt upon his Throne of Glory. We have an eminent place, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not of Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Grace he ſaved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon that Righteous Perſons are ſo ready to diſclaim their own Righteouſneſs, is from a true ſight of their imperfections in their beſt ſervices: A truly righteous perſon ſeeth ſin in his beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; therefore not worth the pleading with God: he ſees his own righteouſneſs but as filthy rags; he can ſay of his Faith, as the Man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> They ſee their prayers want the Incenſe of the Angel to be offered up with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was conſcious hereof: for, ſaith he, <hi>though I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not thereby juſtified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. <hi>He forgets what is behind, and preſſeth towards the mark,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If theſe be the Characters of a righteous perſon: Then a Chriſtian may to a good degree know how it is with him, what his ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. Now do you look upon your ſelves, in and for what you do; are you humble, or are you lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up? a truly righteous perſon is full of good works, but he is regardleſs of it. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a man full of prayer and almes, but he makes no noiſe of them, till we hear of them, from another hand (or from heaven); ſo was <hi>Dorcas,</hi> but we have no noiſe of them, till ſhe was dead, till it aroſe from others. It is the Spirit of an hypocrite to cry up what he does. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. labour to be humble in all thy duties of obedience for they are mixt with imperfections.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:33055:141"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to be rich in good works, it is our duties to remember to do good and not to forget, but leave God to remember the good we do.

I now proceed to the laſt Doctrine in order to the cloſe of this Paragraph, which is this.</p>
                  <p>Doctrine, That the pooreſt meaneſt indigent wanting righteous perſons are Chriſts Brethren, who is the Son of God and Lord of Glory: Jeſus Chriſt acknowledgeth the receivers as well as the givers to be his Brethren; <hi>In as much as ye have done it to the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me. (minimorum)</hi> the ſmalleſt; Chriſt ranketh his Brethren into three ranks.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Rich.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Poor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Pooreſt.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt in his higheſt glory is not aſhamed to acknowledge the ſmalleſt in this relation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren: Jeſus Chriſt only owns himſelf to be the firſt born, the eldeſt Brother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>That he might be the firſt born among many Brethren,</hi> this relation Chriſt is freely ready to own before men. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.50. <hi>He that doth the will of my Father, is my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Siſter, Mother.</hi> A poor creature that wants a bit of Bread and a cup of Water, yet if he be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified he is Chriſts Brother.</p>
                  <p>But how comes Chriſt to be a Chriſtians Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſ.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt and they have one Father, God. This is Plentifully acknowledged in Scripture,

So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let me from this Doctrine urge a few inſtances and conclude.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What a Treaſury is herein opened of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and incouragement to pooreſt Saints? art thou indeed Sanctified in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he is thy Brother; this conſideration ſpeaks great comfort to Saints in every condition, and in every duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to thy Tryal and Judgment, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thou art to be tryed and judged by thy elder Brother; he that is in that immenſe power, and tranſcendent glory, may a true believer ſay, is my Brother, my Fathers Son. It was a great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons (when once they came to know it) that <hi>Joſeph</hi> who was in ſuch honour in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was their Brother, <hi>I am your Brother,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then if you can but upon ſure grounds prove this relation, that you are Chriſts Brethren, that your extract is from the ſame Father, then you are great He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If Sons then eires, heires of God, joynt-heires with Chriſt.</hi> There is a large in heritance to be divided among the Sons of God who are Chriſts Brethren, if
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33055:142"/>thou findeſt thy ſelf thus near related to God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Labour to walk worthy of ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that you ſtain not the reputation of your kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. It is ſtoried of a Heathen that was invited to a great Banquet, and he heard there was to be there preſent a noted Harlot, the Heathen asks Counſel how he ſhould behave himſelf there; it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Only remember thou art ſuch a Kings Son.</hi> So only at all times remember thou art Chriſts Brother, this remembred will guide thee how to walk.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If Chriſt owns the pooreſt for his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, do ſo alſo in the Church, own the pooreſt member if Sanctified, be not aſhamed to call them Brethren though thou art rich.</p>
                  <p>So much for that Paragraph ending with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="41" type="verse">
                  <p>We now proceed to ver. 41. <q>

                  <p>We now proceed to the ſecond part of Chriſts Judicial proceeding on his Throne relating to thoſe now on the left hand. And the manner of Chriſts proceeding is after the ſame manner as before with the righteous.</p>

                  <p>That which we have firſt to take notice of is the dreadful ſevere ſentence which is here pronounc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a conſiderable part of the flock divided out of the vaſt number convened before Chriſt, called <hi>theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the left hand,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:33055:143"/>
                  <p>In order to which dreadful ſentence we have two Circumſtances by the way as an Introduction unto it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The time when this ſentence is pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or takes place, ſet forth by this Adverb of time <hi>[Then]</hi> at the ſame time, immediately after his clearing the Sheep, and then when Chriſt is in his glory with all his holy Angels. <hi>[Then]</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is careful to note the circumſtance of time, as I might ſhew you all along, and not as an empty circumſtance, but it hath weight in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>Then was Chriſt led into the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> derneſs to be tempted,</hi> in order after ſuch preceeding occurrences.</p>
                  <p>So here, after Chriſt in his imperial glory hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated his deaily beloved Brethren with an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable face of love and delight, he now changeth his face and turns to theſe on the other hand; his ſmiles are turned to frowns, his love to wrath.</p>
                  <p>The Second Circumſtonce by way of Introduction is the Character of the perſons who are here decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered by <hi>thoſe on the left hand,</hi> who before might have eaſily underſtood their ſtate by their ſeparation to that ſide from the reſt. From this Preface I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note by the way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the order of Chriſts proceeding in judgment is to begin with the beſt firſt. Firſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch the righteous into their intended glory, and then proceed with the worſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the dreadful and amazing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon reprobates may be by them perceived and underſtood before-hand, there was enough done in their firſt diſcountenance to amaze them. The dread of the wicked begins <hi>before the time,</hi> as the joy of the Saints: when the judge on the Bench cryes, Tye him up, it is a dreadful beginning of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33055:143"/>his horror. The dread of reprobates may be read beforehand even in the conſcience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater.</hi> Againſt this ſuppoſal may be objected the bold Plea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Luk</hi> 13. To which I briefly anſwer, that none can ſo plead but ſuch as have made a conſiderable profeſſion as thoſe had done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though theſe might have known that their no acquaintance and Communion with Chriſt in their lives, might have been a ſad preſage of this ſentence; yet their eye was ſo fixed upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they ſtood in to Chriſt with the high Services in his name, that they could not admit of thoughts of condemnation. See how they plead with Chriſt notwithſtanding this ſeparation, as if they were wronged by him: from whence we may gather, that theſe were not the prophane or ignorant world on the left hand, but bad profeſſors as you have heard, and the circumſtance of time alſo doth confirm the truth. It is then, the ſame time when Chriſt is upon his Throne and all the Angels about him.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to the ſentence it ſelf, which breaths out nothing but dread, horror and amazement to thoſe concerned in it. We have in this Sentence two conſiderable variations from the former Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: Thoſe before are ſaid to be <hi>bloſſed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> here only <hi>ye curſed,</hi> not ſaid <hi>ye accurſed of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the former it is ſaid, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory</hi> was <hi>prepared for you,</hi> on purpoſe for you.</p>
                  <p>But here it is ſaid <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> not ſaid <hi>prepared for you</hi> (that is to ſay <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally;</hi>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was prepared for him and his Angels.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:33055:144"/>
                  <p>We have in this Sentence ſeveral pathetical and Emphatical words and expreſſions; as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Depart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ye accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Into fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Prepared</hi> or made ready <hi>for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Sentence divides it ſelf into two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The puniſhment of loſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Puniſhment of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Privation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Infliction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe concerned in this Sentence ſuffer the loſs of Chriſts face and favour, which is a great loſs conſidered as to Chriſt in this his glory at that time, as I ſhewed you before in the former Sentence, theſe are excluded from that amiable face of his whom to ſee in his glory is a great priviledge, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33. <hi>The righteous ſhall ſee the King in his glory.</hi> This Sentence is ſuppoſed to be with much wrath in the face; therefore <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reads our Text thus; <hi>Then with an horrible look turning to thoſe that ſhall be on the left hand, he ſhall give a terrible Sentence; get you away from me, you whom the world flattreed but by me accurſed; go into fire that never ſhall be quenched, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. So he.</hi> The vulgar Latin alſo reads, <hi>Get you away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This puniſhment in the particular ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication from the face and preſence of Chriſt in all his glory, <hi>Depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not only <hi>depart,</hi> but depart as curſed as execrable filthy things or perſons; they ſuffer an eternal Excommunication from the preſence of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33055:144"/>Chriſt in all his glory. This part of the puniſhment of evil believers ſome account the worſt part of their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The poſitive puniſhment, and that contains three Circumſtances</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The everlaſtingneſs and eternity of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Society in this miſery, <hi>the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for brevitys ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e I ſhall ſumm up all that is implyed and expreſt in this Sentence; into ſix Doctrinal points.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Doct.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt in his ſecond coming will appear with ireful Countenance, with wrath in his face, whilſt he is judging wicked uncharitable perſons at his Bar.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Doct.</hi> That the puniſhment of Reprobates doth not only conſiſt in loſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ace and favour of God, but in a moſt exquiſite infliction of Soul and body miſery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Doct.</hi> That the puniſhment of Reprobates and ſuch who are accurſed from Chriſts Bar, is endleſs and everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Doct.</hi> That the puniſhment of Reprobates was originally prepared for the Devil and his aſſociates.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Doct.</hi> That one part of the puniſhment of theſe accurſed by Chriſt at his Barlyeth in this their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſociety with Devils.</p>
                  <p>A few words to theſe in order, and firſt to the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The ire and anger of Chriſt appearing in his face at this day ſo contrary to what appears from him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33055:145"/>to the righteous, this is propheſied of in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Then ſhall he ſpeak to them in his wrath. Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>who knows the power of thine anger? Pſal.</hi> 7.6. <hi>who can ſtand in thy ſight when thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> angry?</hi> Therefore <hi>David</hi> deſireth that he would not <hi>rebuke him in his wrath, Pſal.</hi> 6. And that Chriſt (as well as God ſo conſidered) can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5. it is ſaid that Chriſt <hi>looked on them with anger.</hi> And Chriſts anger conſidered in that day is very terrible; he is then a Lyon. <hi>The wrath of a King, Solomom</hi> ſaith, <hi>is as the roaring of a Lyon,</hi> as meſſengers of Death. Wrath in man is his rage; but wrath in God is his reaſon. There is great power in God and Chriſts anger, or look of God. With anger is <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Hoſt ſpoiled. Chriſt but looking upon his enemies that ſought him, with an <hi>[I am he]</hi> they fall backward, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this Doctrine may ſerve to a waken Profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>What Profeſſors and Subjects of Chriſts wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful face? this may be, if you be not careful in duties of obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſad and dreadful ſtate of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unworthy walkers, doth ſerve to ſet forth the inexpreſſible happy ſtate of the righteous who are friends to Chriſt, that ſhall have his ſmiles and embraces at this day, unto whom Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Well done, enter into thy Maſters joy with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Walk ſo as to keep in love and favour with Chriſt here; keep communion here, for it will be ſad to fall into this day of his wrath. But becauſe this Doctrine is but implyed, I ſhall ſay no more to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> Wicked and uncharitable perſons are not only rejected from Chriſts preſence, but rejected as
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33055:145"/>accurſed with loathing and deteſtation.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine contains two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are rejected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As accurſed.</p>
                  <p>They are bid to depart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. Where we have the ſame word, <hi>Depart from me.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.27. <hi>Depart ye that work iniquity.</hi> Now this rejection muſt needs be very ſad and a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is the pure and proper effects of Chriſts wrath and ſore diſpleaſure; it is a token of high diſpleaſure to ſay to a man or woman, Get you hence; I had rather have your room than your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A great and heavy puniſhment becauſe it is the fruit of our own doings, rejecting the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred love of Chriſt in time, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. <hi>Surely he ſcorneth the ſcorner.</hi> Theſe rejected him firſt from their hearts; though they profeſt him yet did not poſſeſs him by his Spirit and love in their hearts. Many do in effect ſay to him Depart, <hi>Job</hi> 21.22. they care not for his pure preſence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This baniſhment from Chriſts preſence is a great puniſhment, from conſideration of that great joy that perſons ſhall enjoy for evermore. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A great puniſhment, becauſe there is no <hi>midium</hi> between excluſion from Chriſts preſence and depth of miſery. If once a Soul be excluded, miſery ſeizeth upon him as a Jaylor; and what God ſaith to <hi>Iſrael, Hoſea</hi> 9.12. may be inverted here, <hi>And woe be unto thee when thou departeſt from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Great puniſhment, becauſe for ever is this excluſion; it is eternal, as you will hear more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>If this be ſo that one part of the puniſhment of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33055:146"/>Reprobates is in their abdication and rejection; then ſee the vaſt difference between the ſtate of the righteous and wicked: the righteous are invited to cloſe Communion, <hi>Come;</hi> theſe rejected, <hi>Depart.</hi> The difference is, embraces, rejections. But how comes this to be ſuch a puniſhment ſeeing they do not deſire Communion, but ſay to God, <hi>Depart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſ.</hi> In this day they ſhall have a glimpſe of the good of Communion with God and Chriſt which they had not before; theſe ſhall know now with <hi>Cain</hi> what it is to be driven from the preſence of God, and ſhall then ſay with him, <hi>My puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, See how the Lord in this day proceeds by way of retaliation, whereas the righteous deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than Communion with God, they ſhall have it; and whereas wicked men bid God depart, they ſhall have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, See (according to our underſtanding of this Context) the vaſt difference between mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and members of the ſame Society; as here ſome have Communion with Chriſt, others none, ſo in this day.</p>
                  <p>We now come to the ſecond Doctrine, That they are not only abdicated and rejected, but as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed perſons. They were accurſed before, but now they are by Chriſt pronounced accurſt, and they are accurſed with an effectual curſe. In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this ſecond part of the Doctrine;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew what kind of rejection this is, to be caſt off as accurſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Shew the certain effects that do infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly follow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Give you ſome reaſons why Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them as abominable.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:33055:146"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Make ſome application. 1. What this is.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, The Curſe of God is as an Arrow ſhot out from his provoked wrath and ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Therefore the Learned tell us, that the word <hi>to curſe</hi> and <hi>ſtrike through with a Dart</hi> is the ſame; <hi>to curſe</hi> is as much in God as <hi>to ſtrike through with a Dagger or dart.</hi> Some underſtand this word to intend a loathing deteſtation, and ſo they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that in <hi>Iob</hi> 5.3. <hi>I curſed his habitation,</hi> or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred or abominated his habitation, I loathed his habitation. We have the Word uſed <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Thou didst ſtrike through their Villages,</hi> or curſe their Villages. So that <hi>to curſe, to loath, to abhor</hi> and <hi>ſtrike through</hi> are the ſame. Others read that <hi>Job</hi> 5. <hi>I wiſhed ill to his habitation:</hi> theſe were the words of <hi>Eliphaz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (by the way) was it lawful for him to curſe, ſtrike through, or wiſh ill?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſw.</hi> That men are ſometimes ſaid to do that which they Propheſie ſhall be done; ſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> are ſaid <hi>to pluck up and deſtroy,</hi> when they only propheſied what would be done. A curſe from God is the higheſt token of diſpleaſure. Herein was his high diſpleaſure againſt the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. God curſed him, <hi>Thou art curſed above all the heaſts of the Field.</hi> So it was to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. when he had kill'd his Brother <hi>Abel.</hi> To be accurſed is the higheſt Sentence of Excommunication or Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. And as it is reported of the Preachers of ſome Churches, that in this Execration or Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they uſed to thruſt them out of the preſence of the Brethren by force; ſo it ſeems here in this caſe, <hi>Depart ye curſed,</hi> ye are Anathema. To curſe is the effect of the bitterneſs of the Soul; and from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33055:147"/>that root it ſprang in <hi>Noah</hi> to his Son <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Curſed be Canaan,</hi> who had behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unworthily to his Father in uncovering his nakedneſs. The like we read of <hi>Michal Davids</hi> wife, of whom we read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.16. who when <hi>David</hi> danced before the Ark in his linnen Ephod, it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe deſpiſed him in her heart;</hi> It might as well have been ſaid, <hi>ſhe curſed him in her heart;</hi> for theſe words are uſed promiſcuouſly one for another as the Hebrew Rabbys tell us. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Elyes</hi> houſe, <hi>They that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly ſteemed</hi> (or curſed.) So it is commonly underſtood by <hi>Jobs</hi> words, <hi>it may be they have curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in their hearts,</hi> that is, had light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing thoughts of God. And <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.9 we find that <hi>curſing</hi> and <hi>honouring</hi> Father and Mother are oppoſed one to another. I might multiply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind. Man abhors, deſpiſes perſons or things upon a threefold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As they are infectious with the Plague.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As unlucky, (as men call) as the ſight of ſuch a Perſon or thing preſages ſome evil to him that ſees it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As they are monſtrous, deformed or miſhapen.</p>
                  <p>Now in this latter our Text ſeems to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; Chriſt abhors wicked men as deformed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.20. <hi>When he awakes, he ſhall deſpiſe their Image;</hi> or as ſome uſe the word, <hi>curſe their Picture.</hi> No Toad can be more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by man, than ſuch Perſons by Chriſt. At that day a Curſe from God is an introduction to all evil, as a Bleſſing is an introduction to all good. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.33. <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked.</hi> It is an inexpreſſible Judgment to be curſed by Chriſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33055:147"/>at that day, becauſe the effects will follow. If man curſe, the effects will follow ſometimes; but if God curſe, it follows always. If <hi>Eliphaz</hi> curſe, <hi>Job</hi> 5. the effects follow, his Children are far from ſafety. If the old Prophet curſe the Children that called him Bald-pate, they are deſtroyed by the Bears, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. but if God and Chriſt curſe, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.22. <hi>They that are accurſed of him, ſhall be cut off.</hi> If Chriſt curſeth the Fig-tree it forth with withers away. Therefore it muſt needs be none of the leaſt part of the curſe of the wicked in this day, to be under Chriſts curſe, <hi>[depart ye curſed.]</hi> I have dwelt the longer upon this word, becauſe I might ſet out the dreadful bad eſtate of bad Profeſſors, Hypocrites and uncharitable; they are the objects of Chriſts ſoul abhorrency at this day, they are caſt off as execrable things. As if he ſhould ſay, Get you hence, I cannot abide to ſee your faces.</p>
                  <p>But why doth Chriſt ſo abhor ſuch bad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe of all Perſons none ſo ungrateful, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ch who have taſted of his love and grace and tender mercies. This was that which aggravated <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſin, he had received love from Chriſt from time to time, and he had returned hatred for love, therefore he is curſed, he and his generation, all like him; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.9. <hi>They rendred evil for good; he that eat bread with him, lift up his heel againſt him. Pſal.</hi> 55. <hi>It was not an enemy that did it, but thou my Friend; had it been an enemy I could have born it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is abominable to Chriſt from the nature of this ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſin of theſe perſons is a ſin of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:33055:148"/>theſe are treacherous as they ſtand ſo related <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chriſt. The ſin of Gods own people of old w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by him reckoned treachery; as the unfaithfulneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Wife, of a Child, or Servant is treachery: theſe were his Manual Servants, theſe were Citizens, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> therefore muſt expect more ſevere dealings with than ſtrangers and foreigners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the nature of their ſins they are reckoned upon the account of Hypocriſie, which is the firſt born of all ſin in the ſight of God, moſt of all hateful to Chriſt. The puniſhment ſeems to be originally prepared for Hypocrites. If you would read the hatefulneſs of this ſin in Chriſts heart, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. We have eight foul woes by him pronounced againſt Hypocrites, no people ſo abſolutely the people of his curſe as Hypocrites, the Hypocrite above all ſhall be ſurprized, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.6. When Chriſt would pronounce the moſt ſevere puniſhments to men, he tells them they ſhall have their portion with Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. See how St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to ſuch, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>It had been beeter for them they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known the way of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are ſo abhorred and deteſted and accurſed by Chriſt, becauſe theſe have not only their own ſins but the ſins of others upon them. Oh the evil that bad profeſſors do to others by ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leading others out of the way, cauſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſtumble at the wayes of God, leading the blind out of the way.</p>
                  <p>We know God pronounced a ſevere curſe of old upon thoſe who ſhould cauſe the natural blind to walk out of the way in a civil fence conſidered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.18. much more will they deſerve a curſe who cauſe the blind to wander in a moral fence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:33055:148"/>
                  <p>Some think this may be underſtood to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Dives</hi> was unwilling his five Brethren ſhould come into that place of torment in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. becauſe by that means his own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been augmented. I ſhall only cloſe with a word or two of inference or applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſee by this what a diſcriminating day this day of Chriſt will be. Here are thoſe abhorred and caſt off as accurſed who little expected it; they rather expected to have been entertained with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, as we may perceive by their bold plea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From hence we may learn that nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſs will not ſerve in this day. Theſe were clean creatures in a common fence conſidered, as you have heard, fit and allowed for Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are not curſed nor abdicated for acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice as we can find, but want of Charity, acts of goodneſs and love to Chriſt; they had been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in relieving Chriſt in his poor members: not a word of ſwearing, Whoring, Murdering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This ſhould put all perſons upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and cordial examination of their ſtate; how it will be at this day with them. You may find now how it will be then.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Labour to bleſs, own and love Chriſt in his poor members; be beneficent to them: you ſee the contrary is that which provokes Chriſt to this deteſtation of theſe. Chriſt loves a cheerful giver, and abhors a cloſefiſted profeſſor. So much for the third Doctrine: we now proceed to the fourth Doctrine which was this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Doct.</hi> That the ſecond and poſitive part of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33055:149"/>puniſhment of reprobates conſiſts in real, materi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and moſt exquiſite miſery and torment, extenſive to Soul and body, by fire.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine is the very product of our Text. In handling this Doctrine I ſhall prove the truth of it from other Scriptures, that fire is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of barren profeſſors. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. <hi>He ſhall throughly purge his flowr and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> From which Scripture I note theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Jeſus Chriſt in his proceedings with his own people acts as a Husbandman, who is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in his wheat, with which he muſt needs bring in chaff alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a neceſſity of threſhing, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or winnowing this his wheat in order to ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the chaff, which is here called the purging his flowr.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have a choice diſcovery of ſingular eſteem for the wheat, by gathering it into his garner, a place for clean grain.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have contained his total and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rejection of the chaff.</p>
                  <p>They are executed under the name of chaff, and that by ſire. That by the chaff are intended ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reprobates, is plain from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Fire is the threatned puniſhment of the raſh angry Brother, ſpoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>He ſhall be in danger of Hell fire, (gehenna)</hi> torment. This is the puniſhment of the Tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.42. <hi>They are bound in bundles and cast into a Furnace of fire:</hi> This is the puniſhment of the bad fiſh gathered in the net; ſee ver. 58. <hi>They are caſt into a Fornace of fire;</hi> this is the puniſhment of him that doth not cut off his offending hand and foot, <hi>Mat</hi> 18.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33055:149"/>
                     <hi>Hell fire;</hi> this is the puniſhment of them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>Caſt into a lake of fire;</hi> this is the puniſhment of all thoſe whoſe names are not in the book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.15.</p>
                  <p>It is true it is a queſtion amongſt ſome of our modern Writers, whether by fire in theſe places is to be underſtood material ſire: but the generality are of opinion that it is to be underſtood material; and ſhould we depart from the literal fence and grant it to be immaterial fire, it will be dangerous; for it is a rule in Divinity, That we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the letter unleſs we be forced to it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve other Scriptures from violence: Now I know no Scripture can be wronged by taking theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in the literal fence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we ſhould give way to queſtion the materiality and reality of the torments of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, it will make way to queſtion the reality of the reward of the righteous which we would believe to be real.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it is material fire we have the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of it in the puniſhment of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which fire proceeded from God and was a puniſhment repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting this we are ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If this fire was immaterial or allegorical, the Scripture in ſome place or other would have told us ſo; as in ſome other caſes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Yet we grant that this fire doth conſiderably dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our ordinary fires in ſix circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the unexpreſſible and vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heat of it: as one well obſerves; If all the fire in the World were contracted in one, and all the combuſtible matter in the World brought to it to feed it; yet all this fire is but as a fire painted upon the Wall in compariſon of Hell fire. Therefore it is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33055:150"/>called a Fire of Brimſtone, a River of Brimſtone, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.20. Now we know that that ſort of fire made of Brimſtone is of all fires moſt ſcorching and tormenting: if two or three drops fall upon our fleſh, how will it torture it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It differs from our fires, as this Hell fire is made by God himſelf, prepared, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordained by God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.33. God hath been much exerciſed in his wiſdom and counſel in contriving this fire that it might torment, and his wrath blows it up and continues it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In our fires there is light as well as heat: but this though it be fire, yet here is no light at all; but utter darkneſs, whilſt conſuming fire. We have it often called utter darkneſs; <hi>Jude</hi> calls it <hi>chains of darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs: Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> darkneſs, that may be felt: their portion is darkneſs, whereas the Saints portion is light.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Our fires only conſume or torment the bodies not touch the Soul; whereas this fire taketh hold of both body and Soul, as our Lord teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that kill only the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but I warn you whom you ſhall fear; fear him that can kill Soul and Body in Hell;</hi> that is, after the reſurrection can torment the body and mind alſo. The reprobate in Hell hath his mind as full of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as his body; and there is reaſon it ſhould be ſo, and that they ſhould ſuffer together, becauſe they ſinned together, for a wicked and ungenerate perſon ſins with delight of mind as well as body.</p>
                  <p>We read a pretty parable of an Hebrew Doctor to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>There was a certain man planted an Orchard, and being to take a Journey, appointed certain watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to look unto it, and preſerve it from robbing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33055:150"/>by others or wronging from themſelves; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he appointed one man ſtrong limbed but blind, and another man that could ſee but was a Cripple: And in his abſence the blind man and the Cripple agree together, the blind to carry the lame; and ſo they robbed the Orchard. When the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter underſtood the agreed deceit, he ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them both together. The whole is but a Parable; the moral is this: The body cannot act without the mind, nor the mind without the body; therefore they are joynt in ſin and joynt in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Our fires conſume or annihilate all that come into them, they reduce all into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, turn fleſh into aſhes; but this doth not ſo: here is not an annihilation. But I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak to that afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This is called <hi>unquenchable fire, Mat.</hi> 3. It is noted by the Learned that a river of Brimſtone cannot be quenched.</p>
                  <p>That there is ſuch certain puniſhment for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate we have the general conſent of the moſt approved Authors both ancient and modern. <hi>Zanchy, Auſtin, Lambert, Aquinas, Gregory</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The name of <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Tophet</hi> in it ſelf carries in the name of it torment; it was drawn from the torture that the Idolatrous Jews put their Children upon. They made a hollow Idol of Braſs with his arms open, in whoſe arms they put their Children when their Idol was red hot from the fire within: hereupon there was great ſcrieching with the Children, and they uſed to beat Drums and found Trumpets to drown the noiſe with.</p>
                  <p>This place partly from the Image and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33055:151"/>is called <hi>Tophet,</hi> and the puniſhment of the damned is in the forenamed place called <hi>Tophet, Eſa.</hi> 30.33. That there is real torment to come for the wicked we have the teſtimony of the Devil who believes and fears it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> the Devils believe and tremble at the thoughts of theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So do the conſciences of wicked men who have felt the earneſt of it. Before they went hence they have witneſſed with a witneſs this torment. We have a threefold teſtimony to this truth in the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> the ſcope of which is to ſet forth the dreadful inexpreſſible torment of wicked uncharitable perſons hereafter. We have the teſtimony of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we have the teſtimony of <hi>Dives</hi> himſelf, we have the teſtimony of Chriſt in this caſe who makes this Parable.</p>
                  <p>Heathens have been convinced of the truth of this by the improvement of Nature. We read of one who coming to viſit <hi>Olympas,</hi> finding him cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a dark Cell, which by reaſon of heat and ſwarms of Gnats and ſtinging Flies vvas uninhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he being asked why he confined himſelf to ſuch an afflictive place, he makes anſwer, This is a ſmall matter of puniſhment if he could avoid the torment of Hell fire, the ſtinging of Gnats is nothing to the ſtinging of conſcience. Many Heathens have been ſatisfied that there is bliſs and torment after death.</p>
                  <p>But it might have ſeemed ſtrange ſome Ages ſince to have ſpent any time to aſſert the truth of this real torment for wicked men after Judgment; yet the unhappineſs of our Age is ſuch that there are many whoſe endeavours have been either to overthrow the Scriptures altogether, or elſe to corrupt them from their ſimplicity in all things, and in this alſo,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33055:151"/>That the Judgment and torments of men is in their conſciences here, that there is no reſurrection, no future ſtate, all is here. But I may ſay of ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of thoſe who did in his time deny the reſurrection or ſay it was paſt, (as theſe do) let them deny as much as they can, yet it will not turn it aſide, <hi>the foundation of God ſtands ſure;</hi> there will be a reſurrection and eternal Judgment to their coſt who ſo ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From this Doctrine we may perceive the curſed nature of ſin. Oh what an antipathy is in the nature of God againſt ſin! See his ſeverity againſt the firſt ſin that ever was committed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. In Paradiſe, God curſes the Serpent, the woman and the man. And in the end ſee in our Text the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Chriſt in this unſpeakable torment. And one thing I would beſeech all our Allegorizers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hell torments ſeriouſly to weigh, and that is, the reality of Gods firſt puniſhment; was it not literally as God ſpeaks? ask the Woman and ſhe will tell you it is true in the letter of it, that ſhe brings forth in pain; and do not all men really go to the duſt in a literal ſence for it? why then ſhould it be ſtrange as to the time to come, that Gods threatnings to the reprobate ſhould be as really and literally performed as thoſe in the beginning? That God means as he ſpeaks in promiſes, precepts, and threatnings may be ſeen in ſeveral caſes, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the old World, the making the Ark, the Bow in the Clouds, which laſt may fully ſatisfie us, we ſee with our eyes that what God ſaid is ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, there is a Bow in the Clouds. Therefore have a ſpecial care of corrupting the word of God as to the precepts, promiſes or threatnings. There is no ground but Gods preſent ſilence and defer'd
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33055:152"/>execution that occaſions this thought. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of by God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Becauſe I kept ſilence; but I will ſet thy ſins in order.</hi> God reckons all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be his adverſaries and he will have a time to avenge himſelf of his adverſaries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider what ground of lamentation with great admiration, that the greateſt number of perſons are poſting to this place of torment, yet not ſenſible of it nor conſidering whither they are going; there is but a thread between moſt men and this eternal torment. And this is not only the ſtate of the ignorant and prophane debauched world, that never profeſt acquaintance with Chriſt, but the greateſt part of Profeſſors alſo; but few of them walk as a people travelling toward the right hand. It is a certain truth if I underſtand any thing of the mind of God in Scripture, that there are but a few of ſtrict Profeſſors in outward appearance will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this torment. And how comes this to paſs?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Few believe the reality of what is here ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though they do believe it, yet they put the evil day far away from them; they think they may yet live long and have time to prepare to prevent it, though we have not one hour of time that we can call our own.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others truſt to the grace, mercy and tenderneſs of God, as if they could have mercy and pardon from him when they will, with a word ſpeaking, upon a dying Bed; not conſidering that Syllable in his name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>By no means clearing the guilty.</hi> No, know that as Gods thoughts of mercy exceed our thoughts of mercy, ſo his thoughts of ſeverity alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Many truſt to their ſtanding profeſſion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33055:152"/>and relation, they are Church members. So were theſe that Chriſt hath to do with in this Chapter, if I underſtand the ſcope of this Chapter, and what do they gain at Chriſts hands by it?</p>
                  <p>Oh then conſider, the great and moſt weighty work that lyes upon each of us, is to labour to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape and avoid this wrath to come: And if the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and powerful belief hereof did reſt upon us, it would make us labour not only to deliver our ſelves but others. See what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We knowing the terror of the Lord perſwade men,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Do not be worſe than <hi>Dives,</hi> who according to the Parable takes pains to prevent his Brethren from coming into that place of torment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Examine how the caſe ſtands with thee, art thou liable to this torment if thou dye as thou art, conſider, or art thou upon good grounds in a way of eſcape?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you are in a ready way to eſcape, you are united to Jeſus Chriſt in a work of true regeneration by Faith, Love and Obedience; are you now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the Kingdom of Satan?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Are your names written in the Book of life? for all whoſe names are not there ſhall fall into this Lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>laſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know that, may ſome ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Are your names recorded in the Church of God, as thoſe <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Are you aſſiſtant in the Goſpel as they were?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Do you make it your buſineſs to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie every luſt, even <hi>your own iniquity,</hi> according to <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. from 43. to 48. thoſe that eſcape are of theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:33055:153"/>
                  <p>There are five Circumſtances conſiderable in theſe verſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there is a certain torment, elſe Chriſt would not have made it an argument of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The torment muſt be great the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from which is profitably purchaſed with ſuch loſs and torments, as cutting off and plucking out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a connaturality between perſons and their own iniquity, eyes, hand, foot.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is very difficult and hard Service to eſcape Hell, to cut off and pluck out, eſpecially to do it himſelf to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Notwithſtanding ſo hard, yet it muſt be done elſe we cannot eſcape Hell torment. So much we have in this, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.43. to 49. It is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great concernment to know how the caſe ſtands with us in this matter. Now if upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we find upon true and ſolid grounds that we have ſome good hope (through grace) to avoid this place and ſtate of torment, oh what ground of unſpeakable joy is here to a poor Soul? there is more cauſe of joy in this than can be from caſting out of Devils and doing mighty works.</p>
                  <p>That is not a ſufficient ground of joy, this is. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. But if upon examination you want this hope, remember what is in the Parable ſaid to <hi>Dives, Luk.</hi> 16. <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets;</hi> make uſe of the word of God, that is the only means to come to avoid this place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the fifth Doctrine obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the pains and puniſhment of Hypocrites and unbelievers are endleſs and eternal. As they are not tolerable ſo not terminable. The truth of this Doctrine is plain from the conſtant language of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33055:153"/>old and new Teſtament. The fire is <hi>everlaſting, eternal, unquenchable.</hi> This is the Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I need have ſaid nothing to this Doctrine, were it not that we are fallen into ſuch a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perſons do ſtudy to avoid the force of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which are of moſt concernment to conſider of.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that which I ſhall chiefly indeavour as to this Doctrine is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſtrengthen this Doctrine from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture arguments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Anſwer ſome objections made againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Give a Second ſort of Teſtimony to this truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Make ſome Uſe of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider the Teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. <hi>He ſhall burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi> This fire is called <hi>everlaſting fire, Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Hell fire</hi> and <hi>eternal fire</hi> are taken one for another in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; it is not Hell fire except it be eternal; no fire is eternal but Hell fire. It is called eternal da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.29. But I will give you one place in the Room of many that ſets it forth to be endleſs, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.43. to 48. where we have this fire five times called <hi>unquenchable,</hi> and three times <hi>the worm that never dieth.</hi> Certainly there is more than ordinary in this that our Lord, who is never guilty of Tautologies or making vain repetitions, ſhould ſo often reiterate this word <hi>not quenched, not quenched,</hi> five times over. There is a juſt cauſe of repetition; and by this reiteration,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may learn the certainty of this truth. As in other caſes in Scripture, when things are doubled in Scripture, it is to ſhew the certainty.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:33055:154"/>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth ſo reiterated was not only a truth but a truth that lay much upon Chriſts heart; this eternity of torment lay much upon Chriſts heart, he was much affected with it. And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt would fain affect his Diſciples alſo with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whereas our Lord adds this three times, <hi>the worm that never dyeth,</hi> we are inſtructed in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the ſeverity of the puniſhment it ſelf is endleſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the creature in this fire is eternal and endleſs, that he ſhall not be annihilated in it or conſumed to nothing and ſo an end of his torment as to himſelf. By the fire is underſtood the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, by the worm muſt be underſtood the perſon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this Doctrine is yet further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting perdition from the preſence of God and the glory of his power.</hi> The ſame is farther confirmed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.19, 20. <hi>The ſmoak of their torments aſcended up for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now our Lord is greatly deſirous that perſons might take warning and be awakened before they come into this gulf with <hi>Dives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid <hi>he lift up his eyes being in torment,</hi> he was not awake till he came there irrecoverably. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord beats ſo long upon this ſtring, the danger is very great and perſons greatly ſecure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is objected againſt this truth by our Critical Age; that <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> have an end, yea <hi>ever and ever,</hi> and they urge <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.7. when God tells <hi>Iſrael</hi> that <hi>they ſhall dwell in the Land
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33055:154"/>for ever;</hi> ſee <hi>ch.</hi> 25.5. yet ſay they this is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſw.</hi> As <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type of that reſt which <hi>remains to the people of God, Heb.</hi> 4. ſo it is for ever and ever; putting their preſent and future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate together makes it ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I Anſw.</hi> That although <hi>ever and ever</hi> have an end in ſome caſes, yet it cannot be always ſo underſtood. As for inſtance, when it relates to the eternity of God, when God is called <hi>the eternal and everlasting God,</hi> and where it is ſaid <hi>he raigns for ever and ever,</hi> I hope the objector will not ſay that God and his government is to terminate.</p>
                  <p>So that ever and ever in that caſe cannot have an end; neither will it (I hope) be thought that the joy and happineſs of the righteous ſhall have an end, which yet, if <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> have an end, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in danger to have an end alſo.</p>
                  <p>So that in our underſtandings of theſe ſpeakings of the Spirit of God we muſt diligently obſerve the ſcope of the place and thing ſpoken of, that muſt guide us in our underſtandings. And then it will not appear that what is ſpoken as to the puniſhment of the Reprobate, is temporal but eternal.</p>
                  <p>Some will urge what the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of the puniſhment of <hi>Sodom,</hi> to weaken our poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who it is ſaid <hi>ſuffered the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> To which I anſwer, That puniſhment might be called eternal from theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the perfection of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the continuance of the burning (as it is reported) throughout all Ages unto this day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the nature of it, or rather the matter of it, it was fire and Brimſtone, and that from
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:33055:155"/>Heaven, and ſo of the ſame nature as Hell fire ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe that overthrow and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is never recovered, they have as it were an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into eternal puniſhment as the Devils are ſaid to be <hi>reſerved in chains of darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To further ſtrengthen this poſition, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of reprobates is endleſs, I urge theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments following as reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the Judgment it ſelf pronounced at that day, it is eternal, ſo called <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment</hi> without exception; and it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be believed that the Judgment indefinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is eternal, not eternal to the righteous, and temporal to the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The bodies of each are at that day raiſed in an immortal eſtate, redeemed by Chriſt from mortality where <hi>Adam</hi> left them. To this <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſlept in the duſt awaked, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to everlaſting ſhom and contempt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is endleſs with reſpect to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time when it is pronounced, when the day of grace is paſt and the day of wrath takes place, the ſentence at that day is irrevocable, no appeal from this Bar; as <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Dives</hi> in the Parable, <hi>there is a great gulf fixed ſo as that they that are in Hell cannot come</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſentence then pronounced is to endleſs pain, becauſe there can be no means to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſin, no Chriſt to dye again. If a perſon dye in his ſins, he riſes in them and is condemned for them, and there can be no after means to expiate them, <hi>but the wrath of God remaineth on them, Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 3.36.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:33055:155"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, From this ſecond death there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; none but the Son of God could redeem man from the firſt death, but who ſhall redeem him from the ſecond? We read of no redemption from the ſecond death; not man by all he can do or ſuffer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>No man can redeem his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor give a ranſom to God. There remains no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome will frame an Objection from Chriſts words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. that we may ſuppoſe a payment of our debt by puniſhment hereafter becauſe Chriſt ſaith he <hi>ſhall not come out</hi> (till) <hi>thou haſt paid the utmoſt farthing.</hi> From whence ſome (in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have pleaded a poſſibilily of eſcaping by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer by explaining the Period <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till;</hi> which bears a twofold acceptation in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: ſometimes it is underſtood for a limited time and ſometimes for an endleſs. As when it is ſpoken of <hi>Michal</hi> the daughter of <hi>Saul,</hi> wife of <hi>David,</hi> who deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> dancing before the Ark, it is ſaid, <hi>She had no Child until or till the day of her death,</hi> It might as well have been ſaid, ſhe <hi>never</hi> had a Child more at all. And it is ſometimes underſtood in a limited time, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. <hi>Our eyes wait upon the Lord till he have mercy on us.</hi> We read of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. where Chriſt ſpeaks of few and many ſtripes, ſome ſhall be beaten with <hi>many ſtripes,</hi> others with <hi>few ſtripes:</hi> from whence it is argued that ſome ſhall have leſs and ſome ſhall have more; from whence ſome urge difference of periods.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer; That Chriſt in that place hath not reſpect to length of time but weight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, though in his ſpeaking he alludeth to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> paying by ſtripes, who gave many
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:33055:156"/>or few according to the fact. And this is more clear if it be conſidered with the future ſtate of the Saints; for though it be concluded on all hands, that the happineſs and glory of the Saints is endleſs, yet the glory of the Saints differs in the degrees of it, as one Star differs from another, not in truth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>But it is further objected that it cannot agree with the Juſtice and equity of God Almighty to puniſh a moments ſin with an endleſs torment.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer in three words thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the deſign of the ſinner, he deſerves it; he would have ſinned longer if he had lived lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; he ſinned out his own eternity, and as the Hebrew phraſes it, he muſt be puniſhed God's eternity. As for inſtance, a Company of Gameſters are ſet down to play at Cards or Dice all night, but one comes and blows out the Candle and ſo they can proceed no further: The queſtion is whoſe fault it was they did not play all night? Not the Gameſters. So if the ſinner were not prevented by a ſhort life, he would ſtill ſin. When men lived nine hundred or near a thouſand years they were as bad at laſt as at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that the God he ſins againſt is an infinite eternal God, which doth greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the ſin. As for inſtance; for a perſon to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an ordinary perſon is eaſily paſt by, but to ſpeak againſt a King is death. The Majeſty of God whom the ſin is committed againſt, doth greatly magnifie the ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Such a perſon who is ſo puniſhed is but puniſhed according to his own choice. He had eternal life and eternal death ſet before him, to take his choice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.26, 27. ch. 30. Life or death was Gods offer to him and he choſe this part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>He choſe darkneſs rather than light.</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:33055:156"/>And Chriſt complains they <hi>will not come to me that they may have life;</hi> therefore they muſt needs have deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Theſe things conſidered do inſtruct us that to Preach Hell and damnation is to Preach Goſpel Doctrine, it is the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus the only Goſpel Miniſter. This was the Doctrine of St. <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. Chriſt perſwades his enemies to <hi>make peace with him</hi> for fear of this Priſon.</p>
                  <p>This is Chriſts Doctrine to the bad in the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. and to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14, 15, 33. Chriſt Preacht damnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. Such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Tribulation and wrath upon every Soul of man that doth evil.</hi> And ſee that thundring execration threatned by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Anathema, Maranatha.</hi> So 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. ch. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. The Goſpel is not only glad tidings but threatning upon refuſal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the puniſhment of reprobates is endleſs, then how doth this ſerve to ſet out the folly and madneſs of thoſe that for a moments pleaſure expoſe themſelves to this eternal endleſs pain? Of which ſort are moſt men notwithſtanding. Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> call them <hi>Fools, who make a mock of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Study and confer much with eternity; ſeeing ſuch a ſtate will be, conſult it dayly, and in particular ſtudy this torment ſo as to avoid it; let this <hi>terror of the Lord perſwade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Information to thoſe on this ſide the grave and this eternal torment; know this for thy encouragement that God hath not neceſſitated thee to this ſtate of torment, but on the contrary he is taking pains with thee that thou mighteſt eſcape it.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:33055:157"/>We have one Circumſtance more conſiderable in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Cloſe of our Lords Sentence to them on the left hand which is in theſe words <hi>(prepared for the Devil and his Angels)</hi> and doubtleſs it is not in vain that our Lord adds theſe words unto this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Before I lay down thoſe Obſervations that may be properly deducible from theſe words added unto this Sentence, I ſhall briefly explain them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Why is it ſaid here <hi>to be prepared? To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes curiouſly to work by contrivance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To prepare</hi> is to eſtabliſh, ordain or fix. Thus it is taken <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.33. But I have ſpoke more fully to this before.</p>
                  <p>Who is to be underſtood by the Devil? Under that name in the ſingular he hath many appellations or names by which he is called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſw.</hi> The chief of the Devils is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this ſingular number. This is the moſt proper and common name to him in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the New Teſtament his moſt proper name is <hi>Satan.</hi> This name <hi>Diabolus</hi> ſignifies to deceive, to tempt, to accuſe. It is ſo properly his work to <hi>accuſe</hi> that he is called by that name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. But why is it added here <hi>(and his Angels?)</hi> It is intended here his whole Regiment under his Authority; they are his Angels in ſubordination: as we read of <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, ſo we read of the Devil and his Angels. We may note by the way that there is an order amongſt Devils and evil Angels, Monarchical not Anarchical is their order, called <hi>his</hi> as in ſubordination to him. Therefore we read of a Prince, a God, a King. Of this ſort we have a Prince of Devils, the God of the World, <hi>Belzebub</hi> the chief of Devils. Thoſe are the Subjects for whom originally this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33055:157"/>is made, namely for this Prince or chief and all his whole Regiment. That Doctrine which I ſhall note from the words in order to the cloſing this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is this.</p>
                  <p>Doctrine, That the ſecond death or puniſhment eternal by fire is curiouſly wrought, ordained and prepared originally for the Devil and his Angels. Or thus: That the puniſhment of reprobates is the ſame puniſhment that is prepared for the Devil and his Angels; but one place of torment, one <hi>Tophet</hi> for them all. For the proof of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. thoſe who worſhip the beaſt are caſt into the ſame Lake, and all whoſe names are not written in the book of life; As all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful followers of the Lamb ſhall be with him where he is, ſo all wicked men and Apoſtates ſhall be where the Devil is, that firſt Apoſtate; <hi>they ſhall have their part with the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why is this added, That it was <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſw.</hi> This explanatory circumſtance is added to anticipate a threefold plea that might have been made.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That men might not think to plead an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable decree of damnation to men before the foundation of the World.</p>
                  <p>But he doth with counſel alter the phraſe to them, or the liſt, and tells them, it was <hi>prepared for the Devils.</hi> So what Mr. <hi>Maior</hi> ſaith upon this place, God hath not made man for perdition, but as by ſinning they joyn with the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Jude</hi> is careful to decypher thoſe that are of this miſery by their qualifications, <hi>ungodly men who are ordained to this condemnation.</hi> Some may be ready to think that Hell was ſo provided or
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33055:158"/>prepared for them that there is no poſſibility to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; no, Hell will have fuel enough if all men and women ſhould be ſaved; therefore it is ſaid <hi>for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And again <hi>Maior</hi> on this place ſaith, <hi>Thus he ſaith, not as to the merciful,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you, <hi>but</hi> for the Devil and his Angels, <hi>to ſhew</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that wicked men do voluntarily caſt themſelves into Hell (for whom it is not prepared.)</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> on this place ſaith, <hi>Hell was not prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for men as men, but as men through ſinning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it for themſelves.</hi> And further he ſaith, <hi>Men not God are Authors to themſelves of their own woe; and God not men is the Author of Salvation.</hi> To which theſe ſayings of our Lord do well agree. And Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> on the place ſaith, <hi>Eternal Hell fire was not prepared originally for you or any of you or mankind, but for the Prince of Devils and his Angels that follow him, but now by your wilful defect is become your portion alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſuppoſed that we have this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate any thought of impunity from conſideration of greatneſs; for here the chief Subject tormented in this fire is the Prince and God of this World, the Devil; this <hi>Tophet</hi> was prepared for this King, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 39. <hi>laſt. Rev.</hi> 9. called <hi>Abaddon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To prevent thoughts of impunity from highneſs of profeſſion; for who was higher than the Angels in profeſſion? <hi>yet if they kept not their ſtation, they are reſerved in chains of darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great day,</hi> according to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>Jude.</hi> If this eternal fire were prepared for the Apoſtate Angels, then thoſe of a lower extract as Profeſſors being Apoſtates cannot think to eſcape. After this rate doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> argue, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:33055:158"/>and alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. ch. 11. <hi>If God ſpared not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches, much leſs thee.</hi> It is the received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that once the Devils were good and Holy Angels, but now the principal fuel of Hell fire.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is added that it was <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> to ſet out the greatneſs of the puniſhment of thoſe perſons; this was thought a condigne puniſhment for the Devils, therefore it muſt be very great. After this manner doth our Lord when he tells the Servant that he ſhall have <hi>his portion with Hypocrites, Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>laſt.</hi> that is, that he ſhall have a great puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only urge a few words from this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the puniſhment is the ſame with the Devils.</p>
                  <p>Then it ſhould from thence appear that the ſins of theſe in our Text was much of the nature of the ſins of the fallen Angels, for it is uſual with God to proportion his puniſhments to the ſins of perſons. If the queſtion be askt what was their ſins? I anſwer, That Apoſtaſie from a higher ſtate; <hi>they kept not their former ſtate, (Jud.)</hi> The ſin of the Devils was pride, the ſin of the Devils is Calumniation or falſe accuſing the brethren. But I ſhall ſay no more to this verſe which contains the Sentence.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="42, 43, 44, 45, 46" type="verse">
                  <p>There remains yet four Circumſtances to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto in order to a cloſe of the whole Chapter, and to them I ſhall ſpeak but a brief word. The four Circumſtances are contained, ver. 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have our Lord Jeſus Chriſt indicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sentence to be moſt juſtly paſt upon them for theſe reaſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 43. <q>
                        <hi>For I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and ye gave me no meat, I was a thirsty and ye
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33055:159"/>gave me no drink, I was a stranger and ye took me not in, naked and ye cloathed me not, ſick and in Priſon and ye viſited me not.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the bold and pertinacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of theſe Goats to this charge, wherein they do implicitely charge our Lord with unrighteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contaned in ver. 44. <q>
                        <hi>Then ſhall they anſwer him ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or a thirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have our Lords ſilencing reply to this their plea, <hi>ver.</hi> 45. <q>
                        <hi>Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have a ratification of both ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the certain execution of both, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. <q>
                        <hi>And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have our Lord freely rendring a reaſon of this ſevere and ireful ſentence, <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 43. We have nothing difficult in the words, therefore I ſhall ſumm them up in five Doctrines as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Doct.</hi> That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt though upon the Throne of his Celeſtial glory, in his Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings doth not proceed according to his Royal Prerogative, but according to demonſtrative unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable grounds of reaſon from the Creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the relief of the Saints in their pure and abſolute neceſſities, is an abſolute indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty; if it be neglected, it is damnable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sins of omiſſion are of a dangerous and damning nature, as well as ſins of Commiſſion. Theſe are not charged for grinding the face of the poor, or oppreſſing the poor, but for withholding good from them.</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:33055:159"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Ieſus Chriſt takes the unkindneſs ſhewn to his Sts, as done to him, <hi>ye gave me no meat</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Uncharitableneſs to Chriſt in his members is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high provoking ſin. Chriſt here takes up nothing elſe to judge theſe by; yet here is enough to caſt, condemn and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Iudgment upon them. Firſt that Chriſt proceeds by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative and undeniable argument and reaſon, ſee <hi>Prov</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe I called and ye refuſed, becauſe ye hated knowledge and would not chooſe the fear of the Lord, I will laugh at your deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and calamity,</hi> read but <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.33. See there how God proceeds by reaſon. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Becauſe they believed not in the only begotten Son of God this is the condemnation.</hi> Here is the rational ground of it, <hi>becauſe they love darkneſs more than light.</hi> So 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe they received not the truth in the love of it that they might be ſaved,</hi> (Therefore) <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For theſe things ſake cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Tribulation and wrath upon every Soul of man that doth evil, Rom.</hi> 2. Oh how doth this ſpeak forth the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of God to admiration when he is upon the Throne in that eminence, power and tranſcendent glory with all his holy Angels, yet then by undeniable reaſon to ſtop mouths! Chriſt doth not ſay as Monarchs on earth many times, I will do ſo becauſe I will; No, <hi>Come let us reaſon together.</hi> The conſideration of this Doctrine may ſerve to take off all hard thoughts of Chriſt with reſpect to this day. But I will be very brief I therefore proceed to the ſecond, which was this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> That the relief of the Saints in their pure neceſſities in hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, is an indiſpenſable duty. I put in <hi>pure neceſſities,</hi> becauſe out Text hath it in matters of pure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s condemnation is upon this ground. The want of this duty in Gods people of old made their faſts abominable to God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. We have one Scripture may ſerve in the room of many <hi>Iames</hi> 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have Iudgment without mercy, that ſhews no mercy.</hi> This duty muſt be performed for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe therein we make a diſcovery of our love to God, and without this we cannot demonſtrate our love to God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He that hath this worlds goods, and ſees his Brother have need, and ſhuts up his bowels of compaſſion, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> He might as well have ſaid, the love of God cannot dwell in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſuch a duty as carries in it a true Character of the ſheep of Chriſt. See the former Context. This is the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, here lyeth the difference between the Sheep and the Goats.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The want of this duty is a diſcovery of the want of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33055:160"/>faith. See <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.15. In this Doctrine we have a double rule for our Charity ſo indiſpenſabley required.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are Saints, Chriſts brethren. Secondly, Such of them as are in neceſſity; both theſe are comprehended <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13. <hi>diſtributing to the neceſſities of the Saints.</hi> Saintſhip and neceſſity are the rule of our Charity in the firſt place. Though we are to do good to all as opportunity and ability ſerve, yet the Text and Doctrine is grounded upon Saintſhip. Theſe are not here condemned becauſe they did not level or make all common, but for not giving to neceſſity. The community we read of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. was voluntary and not compelled by a rule; we are required no more than according to our abilities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 17, 18, 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>As every one hath received ſo let him miniſter.</hi> So much for the ſecond Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now I proceed to the third Doctrine which was this, That ſins of Omiſſion as well as ſins of Commiſſion are highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, they are dangerous and damning. Theſe are not charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with violence and rape or ſpoil upon the poor, nor charged for taking away their food.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amalekites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> are excluded the congregation for ever for not meeting <hi>Iſrael</hi> with bread and water when they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. not for robbing them or meeting them in a hoſtile way. Take it in point of worſhip it is dangerous, God hath a controverſie with the Nations, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. for not being circumciſed in fleſh, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> for not being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart. Eminent is that place to this purpoſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29. they are charged with <hi>rejecting the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> for not being baptized with the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This informs us of the bad eſtate of many formal Profeſſors in this day, that content themſelves only with negative holineſs though wanting in poſitive duties. So much for the third Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. I ſhall ſpeak a ſew words to the fourth Doctrine which was this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Doct.</hi> That Chriſt takes the unkindneſs offered to his poor members as done to himſelf. I need ſay but little to this, becauſe I had occaſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>peak unto it in the precedent matter. This ſets out the great aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction that Chriſt bears to his leaſt and pooreſt Saints It is from the dear and choice love that Parents bear to their Children that makes them reſpect thoſe (if but a Servant) who ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ws kindneſs to their Children, and take the il carriages of them to their Children as done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But I paſs this, and I ſhall ſpeak a very few word to the fifth Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ine wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch was this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Doct.</hi> That uncharitableneſs to Chriſt is a very high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:33055:160"/>ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is no one thing mentioned in this ſentence and condemnation but this one omiſſion, the omiſſion of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Though doubtleſs this ſin doth not go alone, yet this is that which is with weight upon Chriſts heart in this day; and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no evil more contrary to Chriſts nature than this: for he is made up of goodneſs, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that pleaſure and delight that he takes in the contrary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>With Sacrifices of charity God is well pleaſed.</hi> But us to Covetouſneſs which is the contrary, ſee what he ſpeaks of that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. <hi>The Covetous man the Lord abhors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See how <hi>Nabals</hi> unkindneſs to <hi>David</hi> (when in diſtreſs) was reliſhed, God ſent death upon him for that very cauſe, ſee <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.38. <hi>The Lord ſtruck Nabal that he died,</hi> for that evil. Thus I have done with verſ. 42, 43. I now haſten to the cloſe of the whole. There remain but three Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more to be ſpoke unto; and that which I am next to do in order to proſecute them is the anſwer and reply of theſe left hand, uncharitable Goats. They ſeem to ſtand in their own juſtification, as if this ground upon which ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds were not true; they had not been wanting in this duty of Charity, they plead an univerſal juſtification to the whole charge in all the ſeveral Circumſtances of it. We may put a double conſtruction upon theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They may be taken in the laſt ſence, of this ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their plea upon their ignorance of Chriſt in his members, laying the whole of the Word there to intend Chriſts perſon; When ſaw we thee in thy perſon ſo want? we never ſaw thee in thy perſon hungry, or thirſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, or naked, and we did not dream in the leaſt that thou waſt ſo immmediately concerned in theſe pitiful poor inconſiderate indigent Souls; had we but imagined that they had belonged to thee, they ſhould have been fed and cloathed. And this opinion ſeems to be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſts reply by way of explanation, ſhewing them for certain that theſe did belong to him whatever they thought, though ſo poor. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be taken in the worſt ſenſe that they had no love to Chriſt nor any that did bear his Image, and ſo were wholly negligent herein; and this latter ſenſe ſeems moſt clearly to agree to Chriſts ſevere proceedings in this Context. Taking of it as a bold pertinacious plea and defence, we may note this Doctrine; It is the property of a corrupt heart to plead his juſtification even to God himſelf and Chriſt himſelf. This was ſeen in <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and followed in Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. This is that Spirit we read of,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33055:161"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>We have propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out Devils.</hi> See the vaſt difference herein between thoſe on the right hand, they are wholly upon a diſclamour of their own righteouſneſs which Chriſt imputes to them; Chriſt can hardly faſten any belief upon them that they had ever done ſuch good as Chriſt chargeth upon them. Theſe are the quite contrary. Self-juſtification is the property of one moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Chriſts ſight. But all theſe pleas are in vain, our Lord proceeds to take them off; which is our third Circumſtance, ver. 45. it is a ſilencing reply, not one word more after this. This reply hath two par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, The manner of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The matter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The manner, <hi>Verily</hi> or <hi>Amen.</hi> This word was much uſed by Chriſt when he was on earth, and it ſeems ſhall be uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him on his Throne, <hi>Verily,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, it is an infallible truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly It is conſiderable as to the matter that Chriſt doth ſo certainly aſſert; that neglect of charity to the pooreſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt was a neglect to Chriſt himſelf.
